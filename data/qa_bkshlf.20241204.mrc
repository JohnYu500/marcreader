These estimates are based on a prediction model of SMI developed from a subsample of NSDUH respondents who answered the NSDUH short scales of psychological distress and functional impairment and who also participated in the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS), which included a clinical diagnostic interview to assess the presence of mental disorders and functional impairment. The initial model was developed using the 2008 MHSS subsample of approximately 750 respondents. The MHSS data collection continued from 2009 to 2012, and this larger pool of data was used to reevaluate the model. This report discusses improvements to the methods used to produce SMI and AMI estimates. METHOD: Using 5,000 clinical interviews collected in the 2008 to 2012 MHSS, this analysis assessed the original 2008 statistical model and the weights applied to the clinical interview sample, while also examining additional predictors that would improve the model. Estimates of SMI using the initial 2008 method and estimates based on an improved method were compared with estimates from the clinical interview sample. RESULTS: This report demonstrates that the improved methods produce model-based estimates that are more accurate because they are more consistent with the direct estimates from the clinical interview. For example, estimates of SMI and AMI by age groups produced using the improved methods were closer to the estimates produced using the clinical data. CONCLUSION: Revising the weights and adding new predictors to the model produced more accurate estimations of SMI and AMI.  aThis report was prepared for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) under Contract No. HHSS283201000003C with SAMHSA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed October 31, 2018).22aNational Survey on Drug Use and Health (U.S.)12aHealth Surveys22aMental Disordersxepidemiology22aModels, Statistical22aStatistics as Topic 2aUnited Statesxepidemiology 2aTables1 aUnited States.bSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,esponsoring body.2 aResearch Triangle Institute,eissuing body. 0aCBHSQ methodology report40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519744/  a(DNLM)1735421-nlmdb  pP2eEFa20181002  aARSb20181009  aCDNb20181031  aAUTHb20181102cREVd20200110  aBKSHLFb20181002  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK519744  a(OCoLC)106105976502904cas a2200697 a 4500001001700000005001700017007001500034008004100049010001700090022003800107022003200145035001400177040002300191041000800214042001700222044001800239050001900257060001500276074002300291086001600314210002300330245014500353246002400498260008000522300001700602310001300619336002600632337002800658338002700686362001600713500010700729500004900836500011700885500004201002510003801044510003701082510001801119515013101137530002401268580012401292650001601416710005701432780005201489780009301541787010301634787009301737856003601830856005001866911005901916935002401975992002101999993001802020994001802038995003402056996002102090998001802111998002102129999000902150035002002159035002702179991157309340667620241118103905.0cr|cn#||||||||011221c20009999ncugr        f0    0eng d  a  2002208427  a1551-8272l1551-82729PY7(Print)  a1551-82809EN7(Electronic)  9101157309  aCUYcCUYdDLCdMYG0 aeng  alcanlmcopyc  9United States00aRC268.6b.R47500aW1bAN78MK  a0507-P-05 (online)0 aHE 20.3562:10aRep Carcinog2DNLM00aReport on carcinogens :bcarcinogen profiles /cU.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program.30aCarcinogen profiles  aDurham, N.C. :bNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, [2000-  av. ;c28 cm.  aBiennial  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier0 a9th (2000)-  a"Pursuant to Section 301(b)(4) of the Public Health Service Act as amended by Section 262, PL 95-622."  aVol. for 2000 accompanied by CD-ROM version.  aPrepared for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences by Technology Planning and Management Corp.  aPrint issues ceased with v.12 (2011).1 93aMEDLINEb10th, 2002-15th, 20210 93aPubMedb10th, 2002-15th, 20211 aIndex medicus  aAn addendum dated: Jan. 2001 revised, accompanies the 2000 ed.; 2000 ed. issued also in revised form as: 9th rev.

Starting in 2001, NSDUH mental health estimates used a cut point methodology based on Kessler-6 (K6) developed by Kessler and colleagues, using a sample of 155 respondents from the Boston area. Subsequent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) research concluded that K6 alone was not adequate for the model-based estimation of SMI. SAMHSA undertook the Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS), which included a clinical diagnostic interview to assess the presence of mental disorders and functional impairment, and was a follow-up to NSDUH. SAMHSA developed a prediction model to estimate SMI using the 2008 MHSS data, and the model was reevaluated in 2012 based on 2008 to 2012 MHSS data. The purpose of this report is to summarize current and prior approaches and to document the research conducted to revise the 2012 strategy for estimating the prevalence of mental illness. METHOD: This report compares the estimates of SMI based on the direct MHSS data, the 2008 prediction model, and the 2012 prediction model. There were 750 clinical interviews in 2008 and a combined 5,000 clinical interviews in the 2008 to 2012 MHSS. RESULTS: This report demonstrates that the revised 2012 prediction model produces SMI estimates that are more accurate because they are more consistent with the direct estimates from the clinical interview. CONCLUSION: SAMHSA has made improvements to produce more accurate estimations of SMI.  aThis report was prepared for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) under Contract No. HHSS283201000003C with SAMHSA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed December 17, 2018).22aNational Survey on Drug Use and Health (U.S.)12aHealth Surveysxmethods22aData Collectionxmethods22aMental Disordersxepidemiology22aModels, Statistical22aStatistics as Topic 2aUnited Statesxepidemiology 2aTables1 aUnited States.bSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,esponsoring body.2 aRTI International,eissuing body. 0aCBHSQ methodology report40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531551/  a(DNLM)1737685-nlmdb  pP2eEFa20181102  aCJMb20181120  aCDNb20181217  aAUTHb20190103cREVd20200110  aBKSHLFb20181102  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK531551  a(OCoLC)108133754101551aam a2200457 i 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034020001800075020002500093035002100118040004700139041000800186042000800194044001600202060001100218245010600229264004300335300004700378336002600425337002800451338002700479490003700506530002400543650002200567650002300589650002100612700003100633700003000664700003500694830005400729856006900783992002100852993001800873994001800891995003400909997007100943998002101014999000901035035002701044035002201071991852166470667620241121095218.0221202s2022    sz a     b    000|0 eng    a9783030833985  z9783030833992qeBook  99918521664706676  aYDXbengerdacYDXdBDXdUKMGBdOCLCFdOHX0 aeng  apcc  9Switzerland00aWI 98000aBariatric surgery in clinical practice /cDavid Haslam, Aseem Malhotra, Matthew S.

As applicable to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), this report summarizes research on the relationships between interviewer characteristics and survey participation, data quality, and survey outcomes. METHOD: This report used NSDUH data before 2002 to run logistic regression models that examine the relationship between interviewer characteristics and the likelihood of obtaining screener contact, screener cooperation, and interview cooperation. To assess the effects of various interviewer characteristics on the reporting of substance use and mental health items, single regression models used pooled 2002 to 2007 NSDUH data. To assess the impact of interviewer experience, two cohort analyses were conducted using 2002 and 2007 NSDUH data. RESULTS: The analyses of the relationships between several interviewer characteristics and various survey outcomes, including response rates and respondent self-reports on substance use and mental health indicators, have for the most part provided additional evidence in support of prior work in this area. Interviewer experience remains positively correlated with response rates and negatively associated with self-reported substance use. However, evidence suggests that the association between experience and substance use reporting has declined over time. Not much evidence was found that other interviewer characteristics (e.g., demographics) and characteristics of their work (e.g., hours worked, miles traveled) were related to substance use and mental health outcomes in ways that suggest that changes in the distribution of these characteristics among interviewers would affect resulting survey estimates. CONCLUSION: The results of this study can be used to produce predictions of self-reported prevalence rates if a change in the sample design can be expressed in terms of the change in the distribution of a characteristic of interviewers. At the most basic level, one can assume that a design change, such as a reduction in the overall NSDUH sample size, will result in a change in the distribution of interviewer experience.  aThis report was prepared for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) under Contract Nos.

The aim of this study is to determine the status of NCD and maternal health program integration, identify barriers to integration, and explore what would be required to deepen integration of NCD care into antenatal care in Cameroon. We used two methods of data collection and synthesis: a desk review of policy documents and protocols and a series of key informant interviews with health system experts and managers working in public, private, and faith-based health facilities at central, regional, and district levels. Although screening for blood glucose and blood pressure occurs during antenatal care, post-diagnosis management is not well-integrated and often requires referral to specialists in higher-level health facilities. Key barriers to integration include lack of guidelines for the management of NCDs, financial constraints for facilities and patients, and shortages of health workers, medications, and supplies for laboratory investigations. Further integration of services for NCDs during pregnancy will require national guidelines backed up by system-wide strengthening of health information systems, insurance coverage, supply chain management, and human resource capacity, particularly in remote areas.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed June 4, 2024).12aNoncommunicable Diseases22aPrenatal Care 2aCameroon1 aKocher, Erica L.,eauthor.1 aNgongo, Carrie,eauthor.2 aRTI International,eissuing body. 0aRTI Press research report seriesx2378-790240uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK602204/  pP2eEFa20240402  aKXPb20240603  aCDNb20240604  aAUTHb20240605cREVd20241107  aBKSHLFb20240402  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK602204  a(OCoLC)143782774807825nam a2200541 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001200171060001300183100003300196245023200229264008900461300007200550336002600622337002600648338003600674490002700710504004100737520396100778520187304739588009406612650003006706650003206736650002706768650002506795655002206820655001106842700003206853700002906885700002706914710008406941830003807025856005007063992002107113993001807134994001807152995003407170998002107204999000907225035002707234035002207261991880292070667620241106163255.0m     o  d i      cr|cn#||||||||240402s2024    enka    on   i000|0 eng    99918802920706676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9England00aWM 171.51 aNava-Ruelas, Rocio,eauthor.10aApproaches to deliver depression care and understanding barriers and facilitators to implementation in people with tuberculosis in LMICs :ba systematic review /cRocio Nava-Ruelas, Olamide Todowede, Najma Siddiqi, Helen Elsey. 1aSouthampton (UK) :bNational Institute for Health and Care Research,cFebruary 2024.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (37 pages)) :billustrations, tables.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aGlobal health research  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: Depression is a common comorbidity in people with tuberculosis. Various approaches to delivering depression care for people with tuberculosis have been implemented in low- and middle-income countries. To date, there are no comprehensive reviews that summarise and explore the implementation of these approaches to delivering depression care for people with tuberculosis. OBJECTIVES: To identify the various interventions and approaches to delivering depression care as part of routine tuberculosis care in low- and middle-income countries, and to summarise the barriers and facilitators to their implementation. REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify the relevant evidence. We conducted searches in June and July 2020 in the following databases, from inception: MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SciELO and LILACS, Health Management Information Consortium. We also hand-searched the reference lists of the included studies. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all records. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality appraisal. We coded and synthesised the findings using the constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as an a priori guide to analyse the barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: The search retrieved 10,982 records, 39 studies were selected for full-text screening and 10 studies were included in the analysis. We categorised the interventions as psychological, combined (pharmacological and psychological), combined with socioeconomic support and screening-only approaches. The most commonly implemented types of intervention were psychological interventions, on their own or combined with pharmacological interventions or socioeconomic support. The most common barrier to implementation was the costs associated with the intervention and its implementation. There were multiple facilitators for implementation for all types of interventions in different Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains. Facilitators were related to the characteristics of the intervention (relative advantage), the inner setting (compatibility of the intervention with existing workflows) and the process of implementation (the positive attitudes of innovation participants). LIMITATIONS: This study relied on published information; thus, it is possible that important barriers and facilitators were not reported in the published studies and were, therefore, absent from this evidence synthesis. CONCLUSION: We identified psychological interventions as the most commonly implemented approach to the delivery of depression care for people with tuberculosis, alone or in combination with other approaches. We identified the increase in costs as a barrier experienced for all intervention types. We identified the relative advantage of the intervention, its compatibility and the beliefs and attitudes of people with tuberculosis, their families and communities as facilitators that were reported in all intervention types. The integration of depression care for people with tuberculosis in existing tuberculosis services is possible but will require the barrier of the costs associated with delivery and implementation to be addressed. This review was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the effects of the pandemic on tuberculosis and mental health services were yet to be seen. Future research should focus on the impact of the pandemic on tuberculosis and mental health services, and on people with tuberculosis and their mental health.

Depression, or depressive symptoms, are common in people with tuberculosis. It is possible to treat depression in people with tuberculosis, but we do not know the best way to treat it or to deliver depression care. Tuberculosis is a common condition in low-income and middle-income countries. We explored what was done in these countries to provide depression care for people with tuberculosis. We also explored what facilitated or made difficult the delivery of depression care. We conducted a systematic review study which aimed to find all the published information to answer our question. We searched academic and grey literature to gather as much information as possible from different sources. We identified over 10,000 relevant records related to our question. We selected 10 studies that described how depression care had been delivered to people with tuberculosis living in low- and middle-income countries. We found that psychological treatment is the most common depression treatment offered to people with tuberculosis. We found that mental health training for health-care workers and more health-care human resources were necessary to deliver depression care. We found that the costs associated with delivering depression care made it difficult to include this as part of routine tuberculosis services. We found that people with tuberculosis and health-care workers believed in the beneficial impact of delivering depression care which made it easier to deliver it. We found that what makes it hard or easy to deliver depression care can vary across different treatments or interventions for depression. We found that we need more information on how to best deliver depression care.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed August 16, 2024).12aDepressionxcomplications22aTuberculosisxcomplications22aMental Health Services22aDeveloping Countries 2aSystematic Review 2aTables1 aTodowede, Olamide,eauthor.1 aSiddiqi, Najma,eauthor.1 aElsey, Helen,eauthor.2 aNational Institute for Health and Care Research (Great Britain),eissuing body. 0aGlobal health researchx2631-761340uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK602233/  pP2eEFa20240402  aCJMb20240709  aCDNb20240816  aAUTHb20240912cREVd20241106  aBKSHLFb20240402  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK602233  a(OCoLC)145653886006620nam a2200493 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001200171060001100183100003300194245025500227264008700482300006400569336002600633337002600659338003600685490002700721504004100748520310300789520168203892588009205574650003005666650002605696650001905722650003305741651001005774710008405784830003805868856005005906992002105956993001805977994001805995995003406013998002106047999000906068035002706077035002206104991880292060667620241107130848.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240402s2024    enka    ob   f000|0 eng    99918802920606676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9England00aWM 1671 aDaruwalla, Nayreen,eauthor.10aSupport needs of survivors of violence against women in urban India :ba prospective analysis of client records /cNayreen Daruwalla, Tanushree Das, Sangeeta Punekar, Sonali Patil, Shreya Manjrekar, Shanti Pantvaidya, Vanessa D'Souza and David Osrin. 1aSouthampton, UK :bNational Institute for Health and Care Research,cJanuary 2024.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (14 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aGlobal health research  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: Violence against women harms individuals, communities, and society. Supporting survivors requires a combination of skills and resources and involvement of multiple institutions. We aimed to document the range of responses that a counselling service should be able to provide, based on direct experience of working with survivors predominantly from urban informal settlements. METHODS: At non-government counselling centres in Mumbai, we analysed unlinked electronic records collected by counsellors supporting survivors of violence. We examined how women knew of the services, how they described their concerns, what they said they expected, and what was provided. We quantified the proportions of clients who required crisis intervention, police action, legal input, and medical, psychological and psychiatric support. RESULTS: Counsellors met with 2278 women clients in 2019, almost half of whom had been encouraged to attend through community outreach. Clients described intimate partner violence (37%), domestic violence by a family member other than their partner (22%), or both (27%). Common forms of violence reported were emotional (88%), economic (73%), and physical (71%); 68% of clients reported episodes of neglect, 59% of coercive control, and 36% of sexual violence, while 77% had survived three or more forms of violence. Over a median seven consultations, 32% required crisis intervention, 31% home visits from counsellors, and 17% legal support; 13% saw a clinical psychologist, 7% were assisted in consulting the police, and 5% required medical care. DISCUSSION: Demand for services was substantial at 200 new clients each month. Key concerns for counsellors were coping with this heavy workload, skills in responding to women's experience of multiple forms of violence and their desire to stay in relationships, skills in emotional support, ability to undertake and act on risk and mental health assessment, and effective engagement with health, police, and legal services. FUTURE WORK: Counsellors need to take a systematic approach to interacting with survivors of violence that covers all the considerations and activities needed in order of priority. We have developed a package of guidelines to meet this requirement, including trauma-informed counselling and mental health assessment and support (https://garima.snehamumbai.org/). LIMITATIONS: The record system may have been subject to errors in data entry or systematic differences between counsellor choices, with the possibility of over- or under-identification of need and different counsellors' propensities for and choices of referral. The spectrum of concerns relates to women residents of urban informal settlements, and we should be cautious about their application to other populations.

Parents could make more informed choices about their child's therapy schedule if they knew whether a high-intensity (HIP) schedule of therapy was better than or equivalent to a usual model of weekly therapy. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the ACHIEVE study was to (1) compare the short-term and long-term effects of 2 treatment service delivery models: 1 hour per day, 1× per week for 40 weeks (weekly); and 2 hours every weekday for 2 periods of 10 consecutive weekdays (total of 4 weeks) of a repeated periodic (HIP) bout of outpatient PT. We hypothesized that HIP therapy would result in comparatively greater improvements than would weekly therapy. In addition, we aimed to (2) determine individual differences in (a) children's response to treatment and (b) parent preferences; (3) monitor the progress and variability of motor function; (4) explore patient and family factors associated with treatment response; and (5) identify relationships between the assessment of the child's function by parents and the child's gross motor function as evaluated by professionals. METHODS: We enrolled 100 children aged 2 to 8 years with CP in our study, which took place over a 9-month period. Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to either the weekly or HIP treatment group. Fifty-four participants self-selected their treatment group; this option was added to the study for families that could not commit to accepting either of the schedules. Trained therapists assigned each child a Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level and completed baseline and 9-month testing. Testing included the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) score (primary outcome measure), as well as secondary measures, including Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) scores. Parents also completed questionnaires on their children's skills, such as the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT). We analyzed the participants' scores using a linear mixed model, comparing the weekly and HIP groups in both the randomized and self-selected groups. RESULTS: Both the weekly and HIP groups improved from baseline to 9 months in both the randomized and self-selected cohorts. At the time of this report, there was a 76% follow-up rate for the primary outcome measure at 9 months. There were no significant differences between the HIP and weekly groups for either cohort on the GMFM-66 (−0.92; 95% CI, −2.83 to 0.98; P = .34). There were also no significant differences between groups on the GAS, Bayley-III, or PEDI-CAT, although all groups improved on these measures over time, with significant main effects for time and clinically meaningful differences. Children with lower GMFCS levels (better function) and higher parent satisfaction with treatment made greater gains in motor function. CONCLUSIONS: HIP and weekly outpatient PT treatments, when provided using the same total number of hours, are likely to produce similar motor outcomes for children aged 2 to 8 years with CP. Parents and therapists can decide which schedule will be more beneficial for an individual child based on their unique personal and family needs. LIMITATIONS: A limitation of this study was a possible lack of power due to attrition during follow-up, which might have limited our ability to detect differences between groups and generalize the results. We may not be able to tell which changes may be due to normal development rather than the interventions, because the interventions were only 9 months long.  aInstitution Receiving Award: Ohio State University Original Project Title: Comparing Two Schedules of Physical Therapy for Children with Cerebral Palsy PCORI: CER-1507-31899 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02897024  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed May 22, 2024).12aCerebral Palsyxtherapy22aPhysical Therapy Modalities22aComparative Effectiveness Researchxmethods1 aPan, Xueliang,eauthor.1 aFerrante, Rachel,eauthor.1 aSternberg, Petra,eauthor.1 aTanner, Kellyq(Kelly J.),eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601516/  pP2eEFa20240402  aYYCb20240521  aCDNb20240522  aAUTHb20240523cREVd20241106  aBKSHLFb20240402  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK601516  a(OCoLC)143645062402987nam a2200517 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060000900189100003500198245013500233246004300368264010600411300006400517336002600581337002600607338003600633490001600669504004100685520107200726588009501798610004901893650002101942650003801963650002602001650002602027651001802053700003202071710014002103830002102243856005002264992002102314993001802335994001802353995001902371998002102390999000902411035002702420035002202447991884007870667620241011154929.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240602s2023    dcua    ob   f000|0 eng    99918840078706676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aW 261 aParasrampuria, Sonal,eauthor.10aFDA user fees :bexamining changes in medical product development and economic benefits  /cSonal Parasrampuria, Trinidad Beleche.1 aFood and Drug Administration user fees 1aWashington, D.C. :bASPE, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,cMarch 2023.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (13 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aIssue brief  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses and collects user fees to supplement Congressional appropriations. In fiscal year (FY) 2022, user fees represented 46% ($2.9 billion) of FDA's total budget of $6.2 billion. User fees vary substantially across FDA programs. In FY2022, across FDA's medical product centers, user fees accounted for $1.4 billion (66%) of the human drugs program budget, $197 million (43%) of the biologics program budget, and $228 million (35%) of the medical device program budget. Research evidence suggests that user fees have contributed to increased access to new medical products for patients and reduced review timelines for industry. The benefits of user fees can be substantial for industry and patients. Using public and proprietary data from 2000 to 2018, we estimate that between 0.5% and 2.0% of the total cost of developing a new drug, complex medical device, or preventive vaccine went towards user fees. Using data from 2013 to 2021, we estimate that 1.7% of the total cost to develop a generic drug went towards user fees.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed October 11, 2024).12aUnited States.bFood and Drug Administration12aFees and Charges12aEquipment and Suppliesxeconomics22aInventionsxeconomics22aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aUnited States1 aBeleche, Trinidad,eauthor.1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services.bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,eissuing body. 0aASPE issue brief40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK603243/  pP2eEFa20240603  aCADb20240821  aCDNb20241011  aAUTHb20241011  aBKSHLFb20240602  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK603243  a(OCoLC)146173477103575nam a2200541 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001800109020001500127035002100142040002500163041000800188042000800196044001800204060001300222100003500235245021600270264005600486300006800542336002600610337002600636338003600662500004000698504004100738520055300779530002601332536094801358588009302306650001202399650002002411650001602431650002602447650002502473655001302498710012302511711012202634711009402756856005002850992002102900993001802921994001802939995001902957998002102976999000902997035002703006991884007790667620241120090913.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240602s2024    dcua    ob    100|0 eng    z9780309715171  z0309715172  99918840077906676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aQU 248.11 aBerhaupt, Amanda,erapporteur.10aExploring the science on measures of body composition, body fat distribution, and obesity /cAmanda Berhaupt, rapporteur ; Roundtable on Obesity Solutions, Food and Nutrition Board, Health and Medicine Division. 1aWashington, DC :bNational Academies Press,c[2024]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (xx, 122 pages)) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a"Proceedings of a workshop series."  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThe National Academies Roundtable on Obesity Solutions hosted a public workshop series in April and June 2023 that explored the current science on measures of body composition and body fat distribution.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity (COSWD) office hosted the seminar on November 30, 2023. Marie A. Bernard, M.D., COSWD, moderated a panel discussion on the critical role Research-Active Institutions (RAIs) have in enhancing scientific workforce diversity. The discussion examined the strategies RAIs employ to achieve student and faculty success in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) and how NIH and other funders might better partner with and support RAIs to expand their impact. Darryl Monteau, Ed.D., Associate Director of Mission Programs Native Initiatives, Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, was invited but unable to participate in the seminar at the last moment. Dr. Monteau was to represent viewpoints from Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). This document details the main points from the speakers' presentations and the subsequent question-and-answer session. The seminar recording and panelists' presentation materials are on the COSWD website.  aIssued also in print.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Oct. 31, 2024).12aWorkforce Diversity12aResearch Personnel22aSciencexorganization & administration 2aUnited States1 aBernard, Marie A.,emoderator.2 aNational Institutes of Health (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aScientific workforce diversity seminar series40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604146/  pP2eEFa20240702  aYYCb20241030  aCDNb20241031  aAUTHb20241103  aBKSHLFb20240702  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60414602610nam a2200541 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001400189100002500203245019400228264014600422300006400568336002600632337002600658338003600684490001600720500001800736504004100754520053600795588009401331650004201425650003401467650004601501650001501547651001801562655001501580700002701595700003901622700002801661700003501689710014001724830002101864856005001885992002101935993001801956994001801974995001901992998002102011999000902032035002702041991886135980667620241104150711.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240702s2023    dcua    obs  f000|0 eng    99918861359806676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aW 250 AA11 aLee, Aiden,eauthor.10aMedicaid enrollees who are employed :bimplications for unwinding the medicaid continuous enrollment provision /cAiden Lee, Joel Ruhter, Christie Peters, Nancy De Lew, Benjamin D.

It was developed in collaboration with a federal Interagency Work Group, consisting of over 20 agencies and offices in 10 departments across the federal government. Support came from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance), guided by a project management team co-led by officials at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alongside the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE/HHS). Input and feedback from outside of the federal government came from a national needs assessment reaching more than 2,000 respondents and multiple listening sessions with people with lived experience, populations disproportionately affected by suicide, community members, practitioners, and suicide prevention experts. The 2024 National Strategy builds upon the previous 2012 National Strategy. It addresses gaps and incorporates advances in the field. It specifically addresses health equity, youth and social media, and the intersection of suicide and substance use. Other examples of new content include the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, expanded workplace suicide prevention, and an increased focus on social determinants of health. These topics are addressed within the National Strategy's four Strategic Directions-Community-Based Suicide Prevention; Treatment and Crisis Services; Surveillance, Quality Improvement, and Research; and Health Equity in Suicide Prevention--and related Goals.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed October 30, 2024).12aSuicide Preventionxmethods22aCrisis Interventionxmethods22aCommunity Mental Health Services22aHealth Equity 2aUnited States1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services,eissuing body.40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604165/  pP2eEFa20240702  aYYCb20241030  aCDNb20241030  aAUTHb20241030  aCollection link Publications and Reports of the Surgeon General  aBKSHLFb20240702  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK604165  a(OCoLC)146457905503396nam a2200577 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068010001700109020001800126020001500144035002100159040002500180041000800205042000800213044001800221060001100239110020500250245045600455264005600911264001100967300007000978336002601048337002601074338003601100490002701136504004101163520061201204530002601816536035901842588009502201650003502296650004402331650002802375650002602403651001802429700005702447700003702504700003502541700003202576830002702608856005002635992002102685993001802706994001802724995001902742998002102761999000902782035002702791991887946170667620241105115127.0m     o  d        cr|bn#||||||||240802t20242024dcua    ob    000|0 eng    a  2024937873  z9780309717373  z030971737X  99918879461706676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWC 5882 aNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.).bCommittee on the Current State of Research, Development, and Stockpiling of Smallpox Medical Countermeasures,eauthor,eissuing body.10aFuture state of smallpox medical countermeasures /cLawrence O.

Yet evidence-based community engagement methods are lacking, especially with hard-to-reach populations. This study evaluated sampling methods to recruit and engage residents of rural, Hispanic-majority communities to identify research priorities. OBJECTIVES: (Aim 1) To compare purposive sampling (PS) and respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to recruit patients and caregivers to serve as research participants (RPs) who then brainstormed and prioritized ideas about services, programs, and research to improve outcomes for persons with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP); and (Aim 2) to publish a practical guide to start and sustain hard-to-reach community partnerships. METHODS: Two county-based community advisory boards (cCABs) in 2 similar rural, Hispanic-majority counties with poor health outcomes directed implementation of PS and RDS. We predicted that PS would yield greater recruitment and retention and more research ideas. However, low recruitment using PS led the cCAB in 1 county to add purposive sampling plus convenience sampling (P + C) using a local recruiter. In the other county, the cCAB preferred a different chain-referral method--snowball sampling (SS)--to RDS because it was less complex and demanding for participants. In each county, 3 groups of consenting RPs, both caregivers and people with CNCP, attended 3 structured meetings to generate and rate ideas for research (total 12 meetings). Thematic analysis was used to categorize ideas. In a mixed methods analysis, RPs recruited by P + C vs SS were compared on demographics; participation (number consenting, number attending); number of ideas; and Likert scale ratings of ideas on importance to improve living with chronic pain and feasibility to implement. For external validity, a representative sample of Hispanic adults from 5 southwestern states was surveyed online to evaluate the RPs' ideas. RESULTS: Using P + C, 62 RPs were recruited; 36 (58%) attended the first meeting and 26 (42%) attended all 3 meetings. XXXX RPs were recruited using SS; 52 (95%) attended the first meeting and 36 (65%) attended all 3. SS yielded more Hispanic RPs than P + C (87% vs 73%; P = .049) and more recruits who were disabled (47% vs 10%; P < .001). SS RPs generated 115 ideas vs 101 ideas for P + C RPs. For 7 of 8 categories of ideas, ratings on importance and feasibility did not differ between SS and P + C RPs (P > .05). The 5-state online sample represented 10.5 million primarily urban Hispanics. Ratings on importance to improve living with chronic pain by this sample were all lower than the RPs' ratings (P < .002), but the order of relative ranking on the Likert scale and in a MaxDiff preference analysis was similar to that of the RPs. To fulfill Aim 2, the UP AHEAD Research Handbook was produced as a guide for investigators seeking to partner with hard-to-reach communities. CONCLUSIONS: Snowball sampling yielded greater and more sustained study participation--especially by Hispanics--than P + C sampling, but the SS method recruited more RPs who were disabled. RPs from both groups had similar ideas and ratings. A largely urban 5-state online Hispanic sample rated the rural RPs' ideas lower but, again, the highest priority ideas were similar. The advisory boards from hard-to-reach communities served a vital role in directing engagement. LIMITATIONS AND SUBPOPULATIONS: The project's methods were adjusted to align with real-world circumstances. Lessons learned may be most relevant to rural, Hispanic-majority communities.  aOriginal Project Title: Evaluating Methods to Engage Minority Patients and Caregivers as Stakeholders PCORI ID: ME-1303-5729  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 26, 2024).12aPatient Outcome Assessment22aResearch Design22aCommunity Participation22aMedically Underserved Area.22aSampling Studies22aComparative Effectiveness Research 2aUnited States 2aStatistics1 aWinkler, Paulac(Of University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio)eauthor.1 aValerio, Melissa A.,eauthor.1 aLiang, Yuanyuanc(Professor of epidemiology & public health)eauthor.1 aRodriguez, Natalia D.,eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604768/  pP2eEFa20240802  aCADb20241017  aCDNb20241126  aAUTHb20241127  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60476808702nam a2200493 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001200189100003000201245010700231264008400338300006500422336002600487337002600513338003600539490002600575504004100601520673500642536022107377588009507598650004007693650002907733650003807762650002407800655001507824700003407839710007207873830008007945856005008025992002108075993001808096994001808114995001908132998002108151999000908172035002708181991887945900667620241115090955.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2021    dcua    obs   000|0 eng    99918879459006676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aQZ 16.11 aHolm, Ingrid A.,eauthor.10aTesting two patient surveys for diagnosing rare genetic conditions /cIngrid A.

The premise of our study is that "self-phenotyping" will be an accurate source of patient data and will empower patients, which may be particularly beneficial to the rare disease population. ClinGen, an NIH-funded resource, developed a patient self-phenotyping survey, GenomeConnect (https://www.genomeconnect.org/), which asks patient-friendly questions that are mapped to a small subset of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms (https://hpo.jax.org/app/). An alternative method for self-phenotyping is for patients to generate HPO terms for their condition directly. Because most HPO terms are medical and often unfamiliar to patients, the Monarch Initiative translated approximately a third of the HPO terms into layperson language (the other terms were too clinical to have a lay-friendly translation). This layperson version of HPO is a much larger set of HPO terms than those mapped to the GenomeConnect survey. However, the layperson HPO has not yet been incorporated into patient-centered applications, and neither the GenomeConnect survey nor the layperson HPO has been validated to effectively inform diagnosis in patients with rare diseases. OBJECTIVES: The overall objective was to understand how best to support patients providing descriptions of their own phenotypes. The specific objectives were to (1) develop a layperson HPO-based tool for patients to use for self-phenotyping (Phenotypr); (2) validate the GenomeConnect-mapped HPO profiles and layperson HPO profiles computationally through the Monarch Initiative's algorithms (https://monarchinitiative.org/) to determine their diagnostic utility relative to gold-standard clinical profiles; and (3) test the GenomeConnect survey and Phenotypr tool in participants with diagnosed genetic diseases to determine which was better at identifying the clinical diagnosis and which survey participants preferred. METHODS: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of the layperson HPO and GenomeConnect survey, we created derived disease profiles for every known Mendelian disease in the Monarch corpus (∼7600 diseases, encoded using the Mondo disease terminology). These disease profiles were subsets of the gold-standard Monarch profiles and were based on the GenomeConnect survey mappings to HPO and the layperson HPO subset of HPO. We compared each of the derived profiles against the corpus of Monarch gold-standard profiles and determined the degree to which the given disease was detected as the closest match. We offered enrollment to participants aged ≥18 years, or the parent/guardian of a child aged <18 years, who were diagnosed with a genetic disease. We enrolled participants from the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) genetics clinic, the BCH Down syndrome program, GenomeConnect, a 16p research registry, and the BCH Manton Center for Orphan Diseases Research. Participants were randomly assigned to the GenomeConnect survey, Phenotypr survey (the layperson HPO-based tool that we developed), or both. We compared the derived HPO phenotypic profile from each patient with the corresponding Phenotypr survey HPO profile and/or the GenomeConnect survey HPO profile (depending on which survey they completed, or if they completed both), as well as against the clinical-grade, gold-standard HPO profiles developed by Monarch. Multiple semantic similarity methods were used to determine which survey generated HPO terms that best matched the derived HPO profile and clinical gold-standard profiles. Our primary end point was a comparison of the similarity scores between the patient-derived HPO profiles from the GenomeConnect or Phenotypr survey and the simulated HPO profiles overall to see which survey, GenomeConnect or Phenotypr, yielded higher similarity scores on average and a tighter distribution compared with the simulated HPO profiles. We conducted qualitative interviews with a subset of participants to determine which survey participants preferred. RESULTS: 1. Objective A (aim 1). We developed Phenotypr, a layperson HPO-based software application, which uses an autocompletion format (the user starts typing and a menu of options appears starting with the typed letters). We adapted the preexisting GenomeConnect survey, which uses a multiple-choice format, for the study.2. Objective B (aim 1). For 7344 known Mendelian diseases in the Monarch corpus, the diagnostic power (ie, the capability of returning the correct diagnosis) of layperson HPO profiles was greater than that of the GenomeConnect HPO profiles. This was measured by simulating patient responses for each disease, running them through a disease classifier, and plotting a receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (eg, the true-positive rate vs the false-positive rate). The layperson subset had an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.95, and the GenomeConnect subset had an AUROC of 0.91, suggesting that the layperson subset can better distinguish the correct disease.3. Objective C (aim 2). We offered enrollment to 1061 individuals and enrolled 282 (26.5%). Participants completing the GenomeConnect survey generally had a higher median similarity score to their derived disease profile than did those completing the Phenotypr survey; therefore, the GenomeConnect survey was more accurate. However, the Phenotypr survey had a tighter distribution of scores for respondents who completed both surveys and was therefore more precise. We conducted 17 qualitative interviews, and participants generally preferred the GenomeConnect multiple-choice format over the autocomplete Phenotypr format. CONCLUSIONS: Both the GenomeConnect and Phenotypr surveys were useful in obtaining phenotype data directly from patients. The GenomeConnect survey was more accurate, and the Phenotypr survey was more precise. The use of the layperson HPO, developed as Phenotypr (objective A), could effectively inform diagnosis if performed accurately by patients (objective B). Phenotypr has a large vocabulary of layperson HPO terms and uses an autocomplete method. GenomeConnect maps to tenfold-fewer HPO terms and uses a multiple-choice format. Future work will involve taking the strengths of each mode of survey to develop a combined approach to patient self-phenotyping (objective C). LIMITATIONS: The number of individuals with any given diagnosis was small, making comparisons between the 2 surveys for any given diagnosis challenging. In addition, the overall variety of types of diseases (eg, the heterogeneity of phenotypic profiles) was limited. These tools should be tested in larger and more-diverse populations and with patients with unknown diagnoses.  aInstitution Receiving Award: Boston Children's Hospital Original Project Title: Realization of a Standard of Care for Rare Diseases Using Patient-Engaged Phenotyping PCORI ID: ME-1511-33184; HSRProj ID: HSRP20181624.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 7, 2024).12aGenetic Diseases, Inbornxdiagnosis12aRare Diseasesxdiagnosis22aPatient Reported Outcome Measures22aHealth Care Surveys 2aStatistics1 aHaendel, Melissa A.,eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604851/  pP2eEFa20240802  aCADb20241017  aCDNb20241114  aAUTHb20241115  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60485105539nam a2200481 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100003100200245026700231264008500498300006400583336002600647337002600673338003600699490002600735504004100761520350100802536018504303588009104488650003304579650002204612650001604634650003904650700003304689710007204722830008004794856005004874992002104924993001804945994001804963995001904981998002105000999000905021035002705030991887946480667620241101145201.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2020    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918879464806676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWP 9461 aPenson, David F.,eauthor.10aComparing the effects of surgery, radiation therapy, and active surveillance on men with localized prostate cancer :bthe CEASAR study /cDavid F.

Although new evidence has been generated since 2008 that has advanced the understanding of outcomes following treatment for PCa, the knowledge gap identified in the AHRQ report remains unfilled. OBJECTIVES: (1) Compare the effectiveness of contemporary surgical and radiation techniques for localized PCa; (2) identify patient-level characteristics that may influence comparative effectiveness; and (3) assess how the comparative effectiveness of the different therapies varies by the quality of care received. METHODS: The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study is a prospective, population-based observational cohort study of 3269 men younger than age 80 with clinically localized PCa diagnosed in 2011-2012 and enrolled in the study within 6 months of diagnosis. We followed the cohort longitudinally, collecting clinical and key patient-reported outcome data at baseline and at 6, 12, and 36 months after enrollment. In addition, we performed a full medical record review for each participant within a year of enrollment. We used multivariate statistical methods to achieve the proposed specific objectives and standard imputation methods to address missing data. RESULTS: To achieve our first objective, we compared baseline, 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year health-related quality-of-life outcomes in men undergoing surgery, radiotherapy (RT), or active surveillance (AS). The analytic cohort for this analysis contained 2550 men: 1523 (59.9%) radical prostatectomy (RP); 598 (23.6%) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT); and 429 (16.6%) AS. At 3 years, sexual function for men undergoing RP was significantly worse than for those undergoing EBRT (−17.1 points; P < .001). The difference in sexual function between EBRT and AS at 3 years, while statistically significant, was not clinically significant (−5.9 points; P = .023). RP was associated with worse urinary continence scores than EBRT (−18 points; P < .001) or AS (−13.4 points; P < .001). No clinically significant differences in bowel or hormone function were noted. We explored the independent relationship of race on patient-reported outcomes at 1 year and found no significant associations. Similarly, we explored the relationship between commonly used quality of care metrics in PCa and patient-reported outcomes at 1 year and failed to find an association. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences exist in patient-reported outcomes following modern treatments for localized PCa, and these differences may vary in certain subgroups of patients. Future research should focus on exploring these potential associations and detecting longer-term differences in cancer control between treatments. LIMITATIONS AND SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS: All observational studies face considerable risk for confounding by indication. We have attempted to control for this risk by using appropriate methods of statistical adjustment and by trying to capture previously unmeasured potential confounders at baseline. Our results may still contain some bias, although probably less than previous studies.  aOriginal Project Title: Generating Critical Patient-Centered Information for Decision Making in Localized Prostate Cancer PCORI ID: CE-12-11-4667 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01326286  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 1, 2024).12aProstatic Neoplasmsxtherapy22aTreatment Outcome22aSelf Report22aComparative Effectiveness Research1 aBarocas, Daniel A.,eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604722/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241101  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60472205835nam a2200457 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100002900200245029100229264008500520300006400605336002600669337002600695338003600721490002600757504004100783520386200824536017404686588009204860650005304952650002005005650001705025710007205042830008005114856005005194992002105244993001805265994001805283995001905301998002105320999000905341035002705350991887945820667620241101114537.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2020    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918879458206676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWP 8701 aPunglia, Rinaa,eauthor.10aPredicting the impact of treatment options on survival and breast conservation in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) /cRinaa Punglia, Natasha Stout, Angel Cronin, Hajime Uno, Elissa Ozanne, Michael Hassett, Elizabeth Frank, Deborah Schrag, Caprice Greenberg, Djora Soeteman. 1aWashington (DC) :bPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI),c[2020]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (84 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aFinal research report  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: Currently, more than 70% of women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) receive breast-conserving surgery (BCS) but then are at risk of a second cancer diagnosis in the same breast. Radiation therapy (RT) after BCS decreases recurrence in the 10 years after diagnosis by half but does not improve survival. Women with DCIS are also at elevated risk for cancer in the contralateral breast. Radiation after BCS for DCIS limits therapy choice to mastectomy if a woman has a second cancer in the treated breast because radiation can be given only once due to limits of normal tissue tolerance. If radiation was not received initially, a patient may be able to avoid mastectomy after a second ipsilateral breast cancer. For these reasons, the choice of treatment for DCIS is complex. A web-based decision aid would help a patient quantify the tradeoffs between her long-term survival and breast preservation. OBJECTIVES: 1. Determine the risk of and risk factors for new breast cancer after DCIS.2. Determine the likelihood of mastectomy at time of recurrence or new diagnosis after DCIS in a previously unirradiated breast and the association of regional use of RT on this likelihood.3. Determine the tradeoffs associated with RT for DCIS in terms of breast conservation for an individual patient in a web-based decision aid. METHODS: 1. To examine predictors of contralateral breast cancer following DCIS, we identified women diagnosed with DCIS in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine risks and predictors of contralateral second breast cancer.2. We performed a retrospective analysis of population-based databases SEER and SEER-Medicare. We also measured mastectomy vs BCS at a second breast event (DCIS recurrence or new invasive cancer).3. We developed a discrete event simulation model integrating data from the published literature to simulate the clinical events after 6 treatments for women with newly diagnosed DCIS. RESULTS: 1. In multivariable analysis, age and year of diagnosis, race, size, and estrogen receptor (ER) status were all significant predictors of contralateral breast cancer.2. Residence in a health service area (HSA) with greater radiotherapy use for DCIS was associated with an increased likelihood of receiving mastectomy vs BCS at a subsequent breast event, even among women who had not previously received radiotherapy for DCIS.3. A total of 1 million women of a given age at diagnosis were simulated for each treatment strategy. The model outcomes were disease-free survival, invasive disease- free survival, overall survival, and likelihood of breast preservation over a 10-year and lifetime horizon. The simulation process was automated to create the model output tables for the decision tool. CONCLUSIONS: 1. We demonstrate that DCIS that expresses the ER is associated with a statistically increased risk of having a contralateral breast cancer diagnosis.2. Geographic areas with more radiotherapy use for DCIS had more use of mastectomy at the time of a second breast event even among patients eligible for breast conservation.3. This work culminates in a decision aid that will enable patients and their physicians to choose the treatment most consonant with the patient's history, characteristics, and preferences; it has the potential to improve both quality of life and decision-making for patients diagnosed with DCIS. LIMITATIONS: 1. There may be underascertainment of contralateral breast cancer diagnosis in SEER.2. The SEER database does not capture radiation use and second breast events.3. Although the decision aid aims to help patients and their physicians choose a treatment path based on potential outcomes, it does not consider every possible outcome patients can experience.  aOriginal Title: Impact of Radiation Therapy on Breast Conservation in DCIS PCORI ID: CE-12-11-4173 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02248662Includes bibliographical references.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Oct. 31, 2024).12aCarcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltratingxtherapy22aBreastxsurgery22aRadiotherapy1 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK605031/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241031  aCDNb20241031  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60503109183nam a2200505 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100002700200245020100227264008500428300006500513336002600578337002600604338003600630490002600666504004100692520702900733536022907762588009107991650003208082650003608114650004308150700003808193700003208231700003208263700004708295710007208342830008008414856005008494992002108544993001808565994001808583995001908601998002108620999000908641035002708650991887945910667620241104082909.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2020    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918879459106676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWS 1301 aBlock, Jason,eauthor.10aLooking at the effects of antibiotic use on childhood obesity and growth :bthe PCORnet(r) antibiotics study /cJason Block, Christopher Forrest, Douglas Lunsford, Juliane Reynolds, Bridget Nolan. 1aWashington (DC) :bPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI),c[2020]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (211 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aFinal research report  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated associations between antibiotic use in early life and higher weight in later childhood. Lingering questions regarding this association include potential heterogeneity of treatment effects: the timing, type, and number of antibiotic exposures in early life; and differential effects of antibiotics in subgroups, such as by sex and medical comorbidities. With electronic health record (EHR) and other health care data available for large populations, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) provided a unique opportunity to investigate these questions and help build the research capacity of this new network. The study was led by 3 principal investigators, and the study results include data from 36 PCORnet institutions in 10 clinical data research networks (CDRNs). OBJECTIVES: The study aims were to examine the association between antibiotic use before 24 months of age and weight outcomes at ages 48 to <72 months (ie, approximately 5 years) and at 108 to 132 months (ie, approximately 10 years) and weight trajectories from early- to mid-childhood. To explore the association of maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy, we also incorporated maternal variables from the data of 7 participating institutions. The study had a qualitative aim to gauge opinions from parents and providers about their impressions of the potential relationship between antibiotics and childhood obesity, as well as an evaluation aim intended to identify accomplishments and needed improvements in the development of PCORnet. METHODS: For all analytic aims, the study used PCORnet's infrastructure and common data model (CDM) to capture all relevant data from 2009 to 2016. The CDM allows each participating institution to store its data in a standardized manner, facilitating the combination of data across sites. Study cohort inclusion criteria were the availability of same-day height and weight measurements at 0 to <a12, 12 to <30, and >24 months of age. Using deidentified individual-level data, we determined the association between antibiotic use at <24 months of age with the primary outcomes of (1) body mass index (BMI) z-score and overweight or obesity prevalence at 48 to <72 months (5 years) and 108 to 132 months (10 years) of age; and (2) weight trajectories from 24 months of age on. In 7 institutions, we were able to link data from mothers and children. For these sites, we assessed whether maternal antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with child BMI z-score and overweight or obesity prevalence at 48 to <72 months of age. For analyses of BMI z-score and overweight or obesity prevalence, we used mixed-effects regression models stratified by complex chronic condition status, accounting for clustering by network partner and adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, including sex, race, ethnicity, preterm birth, asthma, infections, corticosteroid episodes, encounters at <24 months of age, and age at outcome. We also conducted several secondary analyses, including examining differential effects on BMI z-score by antibiotic spectrum (narrow and broad spectrum, with further analyses of specific classes of medications within the broad-spectrum category) and age period (<6 months, 6 to <12 months, and 12 to <24 months) of exposures. We incorporated data on maternal characteristics from the subset of institutions for which we had data available linking mothers to children. For the trajectory analyses, we used longitudinal rate regression to assess differences in the rates of weight change across exposure groups. The study's qualitative aim used parent focus groups at 4 participating institutions and telephone provider interviews using scripts developed by the study team and stakeholder advisory group. We audio-recorded and transcribed focus groups and interviews, coded themes identified during the review of transcripts, and analyzed the code lists using a content analysis approach.1,2 Because this study was one of the first observational epidemiologic studies to be conducted across PCORnet, an external evaluator completed an extensive review of it, along with the PCORnet Bariatric Study; we report some of the findings from that evaluation. RESULTS: Among 1 792 849 children with a same-day height and weight measurement at <12 months of age, 362 550 children were eligible for the cohort for 5-year outcomes; 430 376 children were eligible for the trajectory analysis; 56 727 children were eligible for 10-year outcomes; and 53 320 mother-child pairs were eligible for the analysis of maternal antibiotics during pregnancy. Among children who received antibiotics at <24 months of age, we found that BMI z-score was slightly higher at 5 years by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.05) with slightly higher odds of overweight or obesity (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07) than among children who had not received antibiotics. We found modest evidence of a dose response, with more antibiotic exposure translating to higher weight; the BMI z-score differences were 0.07 higher [0.06-0.08] for children exposed to ≥4 antibiotics vs children who had no antibiotics. For 5-year-old boys and girls who were at average height in this study, this difference amounted to 0.11 kg more weight if exposed to ≥4 antibiotic courses (vs 0) before 24 months of age. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with slightly higher BMI z-scores than were narrow-spectrum antibiotics. We did not identify substantive differences by timing of exposure, sociodemographics, and whether children had chronic diseases. Effects were similar when we examined weight trajectories after 24 months and for weight outcomes at 10 years. We found no association between maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy and child weight outcomes. In the qualitative aim, we discovered that both parents and clinicians generally prioritized providing acute relief to children with an infection over the modest concern about long-term risks of weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use at <24 months was associated with a slightly higher weight in later childhood. Maternal antibiotic use during pregnancy was not associated with weight in children. These findings likely should not affect clinical decision-making regarding whether to give children antibiotics, but they may be important at the population level considering the widespread use of antibiotics. While completing this project, the study team helped create a process for the curation and use of EHR prescribing data in PCORnet. LIMITATIONS: The PCORnet CDM focuses largely on EHR data, which includes prescribing data rather than dispensing data. In a limited number of participating institutions, our own analyses found missing data in PCORnet prescribing data compared with insurance claims and pharmacy dispensing data. In addition, at the time of this study, PCORnet did not have the ability to link patients across institutions. Thus, there was a possibility of duplicate patients in our study data set.  aInstitution Receiving the Award: Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute Original Project Title: Understanding How Antibiotic Use Affects Childhood Obesity and Growth PCORI ID: OBS-1505-30699 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02744846  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 1, 2024).12aPediatric Obesityxetiology22aChild Developmentxdrug effects22aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadverse effects1 aForrest, Christopher B.,eauthor.1 aLunsford, Douglas,eauthor.1 aReynolds, Juliane,eauthor.1 aNolan, Bridgetc(Project manager)eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604850/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241101  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241104  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60485002873nam a2200493 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001500109035002100124040002500145041000800170042000800178044001800186060001300204100003400217245010600251264006200357300006400419336002600483337002600509338003600535490004000571520097500611530002601586536021801612588009101830650002501921650002701946650002401973651001801997710007402015710008502089830002202174856005002196992002102246993001802267994001802285995001902303998002102322999000902343035002702352991887946660667620241105143926.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2022    dcua    o     000|0 eng    a0309689422  99918879466606676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWC 506.71 aWhitacre, Paula,erapporteur.10aAddressing supply chain and manufacturing challenges and opportunities /cprepared by Paula Whitacre. 1aWashington, D.C. :bNational Academies Press,cJune 2022.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (11 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aProceedings of a workshop--in brief3 aThe COVID-19 pandemic escalated supply chain vulnerabilities that affect almost every sector of the economy.

The complexity and heterogeneity of TBI make it challenging to target the right interventions to the right patient at the right time. For those who do receive care, unlinked health records, fragmented care delivery, and gaps in medical surveillance means many questions remain unanswered about TBI prevalence, comorbidities, adverse outcome risk factors, and long-term outcomes. To help address this challenge, learning health care systems that bidirectionally exchange data and insights across clinical research, care services, and public health have been identified as key to improving patient outcomes. To help move the field forward, the National Academies Forum on Traumatic Brain Injury hosted a public workshop to explore the role of learning health systems in advancing TBI research and care. This Proceedings of a Workshop summarizes discussions and key messages from the workshop.  aIssued also in print.  aThis activity was supported by contracts and grants between the National Academy of Sciences and Abbott Laboratories; AARP; Brain Scope, Inc.; Department of Defense (contract W81XWH22C0033); Department of Veterans Affairs (contract 36C24E22P0005); National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (contract 140D0423C0099 through the Department of the Interior); National Institutes of Health (contract HHSN263201800029I, task order 75N98022F00001); Neurotrauma Sciences; American Academy of Nursing; American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; American Association of Neurological Surgeons; American College of Surgeons; American Physical Therapy Association; Brain Injury Association of America; Concussion Legacy Foundation;; Emergency Nurses Association; National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians; National Association of State Head Injury Administrators; and National College Athletic Association.

Although most adults with hypertension are treated, more than 1 in 3 may be unaware they have high blood pressure (BP). The US Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends screening all adults aged ≥18 years for hypertension, with follow-up testing using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) before a new hypertension diagnosis. Clinicians rarely order ABPM, however; they sometimes suggest HBPM but not according to recommended protocols. Whether BP kiosks (often in pharmacies) could be used to diagnose hypertension is unknown. OBJECTIVES: BP Checks for Diagnosing Hypertension (BP-CHECK) was a randomized controlled study to evaluate performance, patient acceptability, and patient attitudes about clinic, HBPM, and kiosk hypertension diagnostic testing compared with ABPM (reference or gold standard) and longer-term outcomes after hypertension diagnostic testing. We also assessed provider knowledge, beliefs, and preferences about hypertension diagnostic tests. METHODS: We enrolled individuals aged 18 to 85 years who had no hypertension diagnosis, were taking no antihypertensive medications, and had a systolic BP (SBP) ≥138 mm Hg or a diastolic BP (DBP) ≥88 mm Hg in the electronic health record (EHR) and an SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg at a screening visit. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 regimens for diagnosing hypertension: (1) clinic BP (follow-up clinic appointment), (2) HBPM (duplicate measurements twice daily for 5 days), or (3) kiosk BP in clinic or at a nearby pharmacy (triplicate measurements over 3 days). Participants were asked to complete their assigned regimen within 3 weeks of randomization. Participants returned for ABPM (the reference standard for diagnosing hypertension) at 3 weeks, with a final research visit 6 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome was the mean difference in SBP between the clinic, HBPM, and kiosk diagnostic regimens and the reference test (daytime ABPM). Secondary outcomes included mean differences in DBP and sensitivity and specificity (as well as positive and negative likelihood ratios) of the diagnostic regimens relative to the reference test. Additional secondary outcomes included adherence to diagnostic regimens, patient-reported outcomes after diagnostic testing and at 6 months, and BP outcomes at 6 months by randomization group. Qualitative interviews with patients and providers assessed their views on the BP measurement regimens as well as their interpretations of BP measurement and hypertension diagnostic testing. RESULTS: Of 510 individuals randomly assigned, the mean age was 59 years; 48% were female, 80% were White, 7% were African American, 13% were other races, and 4% were Hispanic White. Mean baseline BP was similar across groups: 150/88 mm Hg. Among the 510 participants, 76 (14.9%) were excluded from primary analyses because of fewer than 14 daytime ABPM measurements and/or no clinic, HBPM, or kiosk BP measurements. Among those randomly assigned, 85.1% (434/510) had sufficient data for primary analyses (clinic, 82.6%; HBPM, 89.4%; kiosk, 83.3%). Using a diagnostic threshold of ABPM daytime mean SBP ≥135 mm Hg or DBP ≥85 mmHg as the reference standard, 71.7% of participants tested positive for hypertension. Compared with the reference standard, clinic, HBPM, and kiosk mean differences in SBP were 4.7 mm Hg lower, 0.1 mm Hg lower, and 9.5 mm Hg higher, respectively (P < .001 clinic and kiosk). Mean differences in DBP were 7.2 mm Hg lower, 0.4 mm Hg lower, and 5.0 mm Hg higher than mean daytime ABPM, respectively (P < .001 clinic and kiosk). The sensitivities of clinic, HBPM, and kiosk for detecting hypertension were 31.1%, 82.2%, and 96.0%, respectively. Specificities were 79.5% (clinic), 53.3% (HBPM), and 28.2% (kiosk); false positives were 5.6%, 13.8%, and 20.0%; and false negatives 50.0%, 12.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. Positive likelihood ratios of clinic, HBPM, and kiosk were 1.51, 1.76, and 1.34 respectively. Negative likelihood ratios were 0.87, 0.33, and 0.14, respectively. Adherence to BP data collection, defined as completing the minimum number of required BP checks, was 87.2% for clinic, 90.6% for HBPM, and 67.9% for kiosk, with 91.6% of all participants completing ABPM. HBPM was preferred. ABPM was more likely to disturb sleep and be uncomfortable, but participants perceived it as accurate. Six months after randomization, all groups had lower BP levels, with no significant differences in BP reduction, lifestyle behavior, or quality of life by randomization group. The proportion who were treated, defined as 1 or more prescription fills for an antihypertensive medication between randomization and 6-month follow-up, was similar across randomization groups (clinic, 25.6%; HBPM, 24.7%; and kiosk, 24.4%). Among individuals with hypertension based on ABPM testing, 40.1% (125/312) had a hypertension diagnosis recorded in the EHR by their provider between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Individuals with high BP measurements on ABPM and an EHR hypertension diagnosis had significantly greater declines from baseline to 6 months for both SBP and DBP compared with individuals with high BP measurements on ABPM and no EHR hypertension diagnosis (mean difference in SBP, −4.9 mm Hg [range, −7.8 to −2.1], P < .001; mean difference in DBP, −2.3 mm Hg [range, −4.3 to −0.4], P = .02). Providers believed that measuring BP manually using a stethoscope was more accurate than using automated, home, or kiosk BP monitors. Most physicians did not know standard protocols or out-of-office BP thresholds for diagnosing hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: HBPM had better diagnostic performance, adherence, and acceptability than clinic or kiosk methods for making a new hypertension diagnosis. Most participants with high BP measurements on screening and ABPM diagnostic testing did not receive a hypertension diagnosis. New strategies are needed to improve hypertension diagnosis. LIMITATIONS: Participants had to have high BP measurements in the EHR and at a baseline visit to be eligible, and most were confirmed to have hypertension on ABPM. Thus, our population may not be generalizable to those with lower BP measurements (and lower hypertension prevalence). Diverse racial and ethnic groups were underrepresented.  aOriginal Project Title: Blood Pressure Checks for Diagnosing Hypertension (BP-CHECK) Organization Receiving the Award: Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute PCORI ID: CER-1511-32979 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03130257  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 1, 2024).12aHypertensionxdiagnosis22aBlood Pressure Determinationxinstrumentation22aComparative Effectiveness Research2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK605480/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241101  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60548003845nam a2200529 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001800109020001500127035002100142040002500163041000800188042000800196044001800204060001500222100004000237245037400277264005600651300006600707336002600773337002600799338003600825504004100861520113600902530002602038536049202064588009502556650002702651650001902678650001902697650001802716650003902734655001302773700003402786710015302820711015902973856005003132992002103182993001803203994001803221995001903239998002103258999000903279035002703288991891689850667620241108111811.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||241002s2024    dcua    ob    100|0 eng    z9780309717939  z0309717930  99918916898506676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aW 20.55.A51 aJohnson, Anne Frances,erapporteur.10aEffective communication with the general public about scientific research that requires the care and use of animals :bproceedings of a workshop /cAnne Frances Johnson and  Nia D.

There is therefore an urgent need for scientists who conduct research involving animals to communicate more effectively about their work. To identify strategies for effective communication, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop in December 19-20, 2023, entitled Effective Communication with the General Public About Scientific Research That Requires the Care and Use of Animals. The workshop focused on enhancing public understanding of scientific research with animals, how research animals are cared for and treated, the ethical considerations that are involved in these activities, and how research with animals has contributed to improvements in animal and human health. Participants explored characteristics of effective communication, ways to integrate information from scientists into media for diverse public audiences, and opportunities to address challenges in understanding research with animals.  aIssued also in print.  aThis activity was supported by contracts between the National Academy of Sciences and U.S. National Institutes of Health (Contract No. HHSN263201800029I); U.S. Department of Agriculture; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and the National Science Foundation.

The share of eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA rose from 25% in 2010 to 47% in 2021 (27.6 million enrollees). Payments to MA plans more than doubled between 2015 and 2021 (from $175 to $361 billion), taking the share of total Medicare Parts A & B spending on MA from 38% to 54%. Over the next 10 years, CMS is expected to pay MA health insurance companies over $7 trillion. Evidence suggests that federal spending per person in MA exceeds spending for comparable FFS Medicare beneficiaries, with estimates ranging from 4 to 10 percent higher spending in MA in 2021. This differential is projected to grow over time, in large part from differences in diagnostic coding intensity - the number and type of diagnosis codes submitted by plans, which can increase federal payment due to MA risk adjustment practices. In recent years, margins are higher in MA than other markets, while enrollment in MA has continued to increase and the number of MA plans available to Medicare beneficiaries has grown significantly.  aIssued also in print.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 1, 2024).12aMedicare Part Cxeconomics22aMedicare Part Cxstatistics & numerical data22aInsurance Coveragexeconomics22aInsurance Benefitsxeconomics22aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aUnited States 2aStatistics1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services.bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.bOffice of Health Policy,eissuing body. 0aASPE issue brief40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604796/  pP2eEFa20240802  aCADb20241017  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60479606112nam a2200517 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001200189100003900201245010500240264008500345300006400430336002600494337002600520338003600546490002600582504004100608520408900649536019404738588009504932650003305027650001905060650002205079650004505101650002605146650003805172655001505210700003405225710007205259830008005331856005005411992002105461993001805482994001805500995001905518998002105537999000905558035002705567991887945890667620241115090515.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240802s2020    dcua    obs   000|0 eng    99918879458906676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWO 16.11 aHubbard, Alanq(Alan E.),eauthor.10aDeveloping methods to predict health outcomes in trauma patients /cAlan Hubbard, Mark van der Laan. 1a[Washington, DC] :bPCORI, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute,c[2020]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (56 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aFinal research report  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: The revolution in digitizing medical data, along with high throughput biology, has resulted in unprecedented numbers of potential prognostic variables for health outcomes. Recent research suggests that clinical data can be used for continually updated accurate prognostics to optimize medical interventions. We address gaps in methodology available for estimating causal impacts in acute trauma settings using machine learning, and tailor this methodological research to the goals of using complex clinical data to analyze potential outcomes in acute trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aims were the following: 1. Develop diagnostic (prediction) scores via SuperLearner for each of the trauma studies. Estimate the relative prediction accuracy of competing algorithms via cross-validation tools, such as cross-validated area under the curve.2. Develop and evaluate variable importance estimators, which can potentially quantify the differentiable impact of treatments within covariate groups.3. Develop and evaluate algorithms and software for deriving optimal patient rules using machine learning methods.We had several supplemental aims:1. Create new R packages for analysis functions developed for the above-listed aims.2. Develop data-adaptive parameter theoretical statistical framework, providing estimators and methods for deriving inference for a very general category of estimators that rely on data-derived parameters.3. Develop a data-adaptive parameter for variable importance measures.4. Derive method for estimating the variance in treatment effects across covariate groups. METHODS: Our statistical methodology is based on 3 developments: (1) SuperLearning for optimizing prediction, (2) causal structural models to define targeted parameters, and (3) targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Research in statistical methodology might be ordered as the following process: parameter (question) Þ theory Þ estimator Þ evaluation in finite samples (simulations) Þ software Þ applied in empirical analyses. For some of our approaches, we started at the end (empirical analysis of existing data) and for others we had to start with a new theoretical framework (eg, data-adaptive parameter estimation). We used the Targeted Learning framework in the methods development and performed limited simulations to examine where the finite sample performance departs from the asymptotic behavior of the estimators. We also employed the estimators on several data sets (Activation of Coagulation and Inflammation in Trauma program, n = 467; Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion study, n = 977; Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios trial, n = 660) as another check for their performance and modifications necessary to handle messy data. RESULTS: Software for each of the goals has been created with corresponding open source R packages available for download. We developed general and parallelizable software for cross-validation (origami) procedures, implementation of data-adaptive development of treatment rules with relevant intervention parameters (opttx), and data-adaptive variable importance measures (varImpact). In addition to using the data analyses to demonstrate the practical performance of these new methods, we also used them to demonstrate the potential for existing, but not widely used, tools for prediction (SuperLearning) and variable importance (TMLE). Finally, we developed and estimated a new parameter related to treatment impact heterogeneity, creating a statistic summarizing the potential for improved health with more precisely tuned treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The results show great promise for incorporating health record data into individualized trauma patient care as well as well as into more generalized trauma care settings. LIMITATIONS: Given that the data collection in the studies used for this research was somewhat incomplete, these algorithms will require modifications in the future to handle densely sampled time-structured data (eg, streaming vital sign data).  aOriginal Project Title: Semiparametric Causal Inference Methods for Adaptive Statistical Learning in Trauma Patient-Centered Outcomes Research PCORI ID: ME-1306-02735; HSRProj ID: 20143598.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 7, 2024).12aWounds and Injuriesxtherapy22aTrauma Centers22aTreatment Outcome22aOutcome Assessment, Health Carexmethods22aMultivariate Analysis22aPatient Reported Outcome Measures 2aStatistics1 aLaan, M.

This project sought to gain insights into the various forms of backbone organizations that exist in the field, and to gain a deeper understanding of Hubs, including their structures, approaches to community input, partners, information technology infrastructure, and financing sources, as well as any policy changes identified by specific Hubs included in the report that would enhance their ability to operate successfully. As community-focused entities that support a network of community-based organizations in contracting with health care entities to provide services to address social needs that can affect health outcomes, Hubs can serve as the connective tissue within a community to ensure individuals' social needs are met, which can also contribute to improved health outcomes.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 7, 2024).12aCommunity Health Centers22aCommunity Health Services22aModels, Organizational 2aUnited States1 aRasmussen, Petra W.,eauthor.1 aQureshi, Nabeel Shariq,eauthor.1 aPeet, Evan D.,eauthor.2 aRAND Health Care,eissuing body.1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services.bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,esponsoring body.1 aUnited States.bAdministration for Community Living,esponsoring body.40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604809/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241107  aCDNb20241107  aAUTHb20241108  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60480904951nam a2200577 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001800109020001500127035002100142040002500163041000800188042000800196044001800204060001000222100004000232245047800272264005600750300006800806336002600874337002600900338003600926504004100962520082901003530002601832536135301858588009503211650002803306650002103334650002303355650002403378651001803402655001303420700003103433700003303464710016003497710014103657710016503798710012203963711010504085856005004190992002104240993001804261994001804279995001904297998002104316999000904337035002704346991887946520667620241105114924.0m     o  d        cr|bn#||||||||240802s2024    dcua    ob    100|0 eng    z9780309718561  z0309718562  99918879465206676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aQV 211 aForstag, Erin Hammers,erapporteur.10aPreparing the future workforce in drug research and development :bproceedings of a workshop /cErin Hammers Forstag, Noah Ontjes, Carolyn Shore, rapporteurs ; Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation, Board on Health Sciences Policy, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice, Health and Medicine Division, Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine, U.S. Science and Innovation Policy, Policy and Global Affairs. 1aWashington, DC :bNational Academies Press,c[2024]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (xx, 119 pages)) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aDespite advances over the past several decades, the clinical trials enterprise has struggled to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. population. To help address this issue, a 2023 National Academies workshop sought to identify the expertise and disciplines needed to achieve the aspirations for a transformed clinical trials enterprise by 2030 and enable a workforce that can better support the evolving needs of drug R&D - one that is resilient, culturally aware, anti-racist, and interdisciplinary. The workshop, hosted by the Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation and Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine explored strategies to bolster workforce capacity and challenges and opportunities associated with supporting the next-generation drug R&D workforce.  aIssued also in print.  aThis activity was supported by contracts between the National Academy of Sciences and Aetna Foundation (Contract No. 18-8876); Amgen Inc.; Association of American Medical Colleges; AstraZeneca; Biogen; Burroughs Wellcome Fund (Contract No. 1023129); Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Critical Path Institute; Eli Lilly and Company; FasterCures, Milken Institute; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health; Friends of Cancer Research; Johnson & Johnson; Medable Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc.

To address this disparity, we sought to compare health care utilization and quality of life (QOL) for Black and Hispanic patients admitted to a "safety net" hospital for HF. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a telehealth self-monitoring (TSM) intervention or comprehensive outpatient management (COM). OBJECTIVES: 1. Aim 1: To assess usability and adapt TSM to facilitate acceptability and feasibility in a population of underserved Black and Hispanic patients.2. Aim 2: To compare inpatient and emergency department (ED) utilization and QOL of underserved patients with HF randomized at discharge to TSM or COM. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT), to assess TSM usability and effectiveness. Medical history, hospital utilization, demographics, depression, anxiety, and QOL were recorded at days 1 and 90. TSM patients transmitted their vital signs daily and attended a weekly video visit. We analyzed binary outcomes for ED visits and hospitalizations using the standard chi-square or Fisher exact test. We also used Poisson or negative binomial regression, repeated-measures analysis of variance, or generalized estimating equations (GEEs) as appropriate. We based the choice of Poisson, overdispersed Poisson, or negative binomial on standard goodness-of-fit statistics (the deviance statistic). We computed associated 95% CIs for these proportions and their differences using exact methods. RESULTS: 1. Aim 1: We used the ADAPT-ITT framework (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration, Training staff, and Testing) to tailor the TSM intervention. The adaptation, based on data from 3 focus groups, theater testing, and a small pilot study, resulted in an acceptable and feasible intervention for the target patient population.2. Aim 2: Of the 104 patients randomized, 31% were Hispanic, 69% Black, and 41% female. Overall, 72% of patients reported incomes of <$10 000/year. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses revealed no significant utilization differences between TSM and COM groups for (1 or more) all-cause ED visits (relative risk [RR], 1.37; 95% CI, 0.83-2.27) or hospitalizations (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.57-1.48) and mean length of stay (TSM: 5.2 vs COM: 3.6 days) within 90 days of discharge. The average number of all-cause hospitalizations greater than 90 days was significantly lower for COM patients (TSM = 0.78 vs COM = 0.55; P = .03). Finally, while QOL improved for both groups over time (TSM baseline = 62.7; 90-day = 36.3; COM baseline = 59.2; 90-day = 27.8; P = .5), COM patients reported a greater reduction of anxiety (TSM baseline = 50%; 90-day = 28%; COM baseline = 57%; 90-day = 13%; P = .05). TSM adherence was low: 50% of participants provided <10 transmittals of vital signs during the 90-day period. CONCLUSIONS: While the ADAPT-ITT framework was successfully utilized to tailor a TSM intervention for patients with HF from Black and Hispanic low-income communities, TSM was not associated with reduced all-cause 90-day ED and inpatient utilization. The mean number of all-cause hospitalizations was significantly lower for the COM group. QOL and depression did not differ between the 2 groups, while COM patients reported a greater reduction of anxiety over time. LIMITATIONS AND SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS: This single-center study may not be generalizable to other underserved patients with HF. Future studies should address methods to improve compliance to improve TSM treatment effect size on all-cause- and HF-related utilization outcomes.  aOriginal Project Title: Telehealth Self-management Program in Older Adults Living With Heart Failure in Health Disparity Communities PCORI ID: AD-1304-6294 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02196922  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 7, 2024).12aHeart Failurextherapy22aBlack or African American22aHispanics or Latino22aAmbulatory Carexmethods22aNetwork Meta-Analysis22aPatient Reported Outcome Measures 2aUnited States 2aStatistics2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK605033/  pP2eEFa20240802  aCADb20241017  aCDNb20241118  aAUTHb20241118  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60503303263nam a2200529 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001500189100006100204245041900265264010600684300006700790336002600857337002600883338003600909500003000945504004100975520039901016536057201415588009101987610010802078650003102186650002002217650002602237650002302263651001802286710004002304710014002344856005002484992002102534993001802555994001802573995001902591998002102610998002302631998002202654998002102676999000902697035002702706991887946510667620241113094314.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240802s2023    dcua    ob   f000|0 eng    99918879465106676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aW 84.4 AA11 aEvans, Emilyc(Health scientist administrator),eauthor.10aUnderstanding the impacts of OS-PCORTF projects on data capacity :ban interim qualitative assessment /cprepared for The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ; by NORC at the University of Chicago ; contributing authors, Emily Evans, Mithuna Srinivasan, Correa Kiran, Sofia Ryan, Mikaela Harmsen, Susan Lumsden, Prashila Dullabh. 1a[Washington, D.C.] :bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,cSeptember 2023.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (iii, 21 pages)) :billustration  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aAt head of title: Report.  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThis report presents findings from an interim qualitative assessment that examined the ways in which OS-PCORTF projects collectively advanced the ability of researchers to conduct patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) by (1) improving the quality of data; (2) providing more relevant, comprehensive data; (3) enhancing analytical resources; and (4) reducing barriers to data access and use.  aThis report was funded by the Office of the Secretary Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (OS-PCORTF) under Contract Number HHSP233201500048II of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).

The infection is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tsetse fly. The parasite multiplies in the lymph and blood, causing unspecific symptoms and signs (first-stage or haemo-lymphatic stage) and, over time, crosses the blood-brain barrier to infect the central nervous system (second-stage or meningo-encephalitic stage). Brain involvement causes various neurological disturbances, including sleep disorders (hence the name "sleeping sickness"), progression to coma and, ultimately, death. The disease has two forms: the slowly progressing form (gambiense HAT), caused by infection with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, found in western and central Africa (92% of cases in 2018-2022); and the more rapidly progressive form (rhodesiense HAT), caused by infection with T. b. rhodesiense, in eastern and southern Africa (responsible for the remainder of cases). All age groups and both sexes are at risk of both forms of HAT, although prevalence is higher in adults than in children. The incidence of the disease has strongly declined in response to intensive surveillance and control interventions in endemic areas. As a result, HAT is among the neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization (WHO). The remarkable progress in the control of gambiense HAT has relied on case-finding and curative treatment, which interrupts transmission by depleting the reservoir of parasites in humans. This has been combined in some areas with vector control activities. In contrast to gambiense HAT, treatment of rhodesiense HAT patients has little impact on disease transmission, but it is certainly life-saving. The WHO interim guidelines for the treatment of gambiense HAT, issued in 2019 added as a therapeutic option the new medicine fexinidazole. Thanks to its recent extension of indication, fexinidazole is now also recommended for treatment of rhodesiense HAT. The present guidelines incorporate all these changes, leading to a substantial reconfiguration of therapeutic choices for both disease forms. HAT is a serious, life-threatening disease and the efficacy of fexinidazole depends on swallowing the medicine after an appropriate intake of food as well as on completing the full 10-day treatment schedule. Therefore, the recommendations regarding fexinidazole administration are considered key elements that must be carefully followed. When the conditions listed in these guidelines are not met for any individual patient, the alternative available treatments should be prescribed.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed October 17, 2024).12aTrypanosomiasis, Africanxtherapy22aNeglected Diseases 2aPractice Guideline40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604893/  pP2eEFa20240802  aCADb20241017  aCDNb20241017  aAUTHb20241017  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK604893  a(OCoLC)146350410503126nam a2200505 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100003400200245033400234264008700568300006700655336002600722337002600748338003600774490003200810504004100842520066300883536041301546588009501959650004102054650005702095650004002152650003002192650003702222650002602259651001802285710009702303830003702400856005002437992002102487993001802508994001802526995001902544998002102563999000902584035002702593991887946120667620241101081103.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240802s2022    dcua    ob   f000|0 eng    99918879461206676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aQZ 1851 aMarcial, Laura Haak,eauthor.10aImplementation of an electronic care plan for people with multiple chronic conditions :bfinal report /cLaura Haak Marcial, Sara Armson, Keegan Barnes, Eric Puster, Jeanette Renaud, Jacqueline Bagwell, Djibril Camara, Michelle Bobo, MJ Dunne, Matthew Storer, David Dorr ; prepared for Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. 1aRockville, MD :bAHRQ, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,cNovember 2022.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (x, 73 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAHRQ publication ;v23-0010  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThe purpose of this project was to develop and test a suite of electronic Care Plan (eCP) tools for adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), including an eCP implementation guide specifying data standards and value sets for key use case conditions and two open-source eCP apps (one for patients and one for clinicians).

Emulating the design and analysis of a target trial using a cohort design (causal CER methods) reduces potential for several major biases in observational CER. Large cohort studies often use electronic medical record (EMR) data without validating key variables due to feasibility constraints. Using a case-control design provides the opportunity to reduce measurement bias by validating measures of eligibility, exposure, confounders, and outcome using resource-intensive data collection methods such as medical record review within a much smaller population compared with the entire cohort. However, causal CER methods for case-control studies do not yet exist, leaving researchers to choose between using either advanced analytical methods with potentially lower-quality data from a cohort design or a conventional case-control design with higher-quality data. OBJECTIVES: To reduce bias in CER by developing methods to emulate the design and analysis of a target trial using high-quality measurements and a case-control design. METHODS: We developed a guideline and an analytical program to emulate the design and analysis of a target trial using a case-control design. The guideline provides details on how the data should be structured and how to use the accompanying SAS macro to implement the observational analogues of intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses in a case-control design. We conducted 2 sets of interviews with 20 investigators and data analysts and incorporated their comments into the guideline. For our clinical example, we used cohort data from Kaiser Permanente Washington and a case-control study (nested within the same system) that had previously validated case and control status using medical record reviews. We emulated the design and analysis of a target trial of statin therapy among healthy participants. The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). RESULTS: Using a cohort design to emulate a primary prevention statin trial, we selected 76 020 eligible participants into an analytic cohort. During an average follow-up of 73 months, we observed 1318 events. Compared with a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.60-0.79) reported in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, the observational analogue of the ITT HR using a cohort design and outcomes based on ICD codes was 1.01 (0.91-1.12), and the ITT odds ratio (OR) using a case-control design and validated case and control status was 0.80 (0.69-0.92). A case-control analysis that measured eligibility, exposures, and confounders at the index date yielded an adjusted OR of 1.12 (0.96-1.31), which suggests a harmful effect of statins on MI. Adherence to assigned treatment in our study population was low, with 70% of initiators discontinuing treatment within 5 years. After adjusting for imperfect adherence by censoring nonadherent person-times and adjusting for time-varying determinants of adherence via inverse probability weighting, the per-protocol HR was 0.80 (0.67-0.94) in the cohort design using ICD codes and the corresponding OR was 0.71 (0.58-0.87) in the case-control design using validated cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to replicate the results of statin trials on MI prevention using a causal case-control design and outcome data that were validated using medical record reviews. In contrast, a cohort design that did not use validated outcomes produced null results due to measurement error and lower adherence, and a conventional case-control design with validated events yielded substantially biased results due to a different definition of eligibility and exposure and inappropriate adjustment for confounders. LIMITATIONS: The causal analysis of case-control data requires that the case-control study be nested in a health care system with longitudinal EMR data, which does not apply to many existing studies. Our analyses used only 1 example; further research is needed to examine whether these findings generalize to other drug exposures and health outcomes.Includes bibliographical references.  aInstitution Receiving Award: Harvard T.H.

This HHS Call to Action is being issued with the intent of catalyzing efforts at the community-level to encourage partnerships across sectors, including health care, social services, public and environmental health, government, and health information technology to address social needs with the goal of improving the health and well-being of every American. It describes key actions that partners in different sectors can take to help build a stronger, more integrated health and social care system, and it provides resources applicable to partners involved in each set of actions. It also discusses the important role that backbone organizations, including community care hubs, can play in managing community-based partnerships across sectors and how they can help develop and sustain the community-based infrastructure needed to improve coordination between health and social care providers.  aIssued also in print.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 13, 2024).12aHealth Services Needs and Demand22aCommunity Networks22aCommunity Supportxmethods22aSocial Determinants of Health 2aUnited States1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services.bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,eissuing body.40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK604980/  pP2eEFa20240802  aYYCb20241030  aCDNb20241113  aAUTHb20241118  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60498002253nam a2200505 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189245016700200264017000367300006300537336002600600337002600626338003600652490001100688504004100699520031200740530002601052588009101078610004201169650002601211650003101237650002401268650002001292650003701312651001801349655001501367710016601382830001601548856005001564992002101614993001801635994001801653995001901671998002101690999000901711035002701720991887946490667620241106124545.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240802s2023    dcua    obs  f000|0 eng    99918879464906676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWX 21500aFactors contributing to reductions in patient wait times at Indian Health Service emergency department facilities :ba mixed-methods assessment : research report. 1aWashington, D.C. :bDepartment of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Office of Health Policy,cFebruary 2023 .  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (18 pages)) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aReport  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aThis ASPE Research Report summarizes findings about factors affecting Emergency Department wait times and Primary Care appointment scheduling intervals, and it describes strategies Indian Health Service (IHS) federal facilities have implemented associated with decreased wait times in Emergency Departments.  aIssued also in print.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 6, 2024).12aUnited States.bIndian Health Service12aEmergency Room Visits22aAppointments and Schedules22aPrimary Health Care22aMinority Health22aAmerican Indian or Alaska Native 2aUnited States 2aStatistics1 aUnited States.bDepartment of Health and Human Services.bOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.bOffice of Health Policy,eissuing body. 0aASPE report40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK605136/  pP2eEFa20240802  aIHHb20241106  aCDNb20241106  aAUTHb20241106  aBKSHLFb20240802  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60513604760nam a2200457 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100003000200245025200230264008500482300006300567336002600630337002600656338003600682504004100718520281500759536018003574588009203754650003403846650003203880650002303912650003203935710007203967830008004039856005004119992002104169993001804190994001804208995001904226998002104245999000904266035002704275991891689370667620241101080220.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||241002s2019    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918916893706676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWE 8701 aAllen, Kelli D.,eauthor.10aComparing physical therapy, internet-based exercise training, and no therapy for knee osteoarthritis /cKelli D.

Few studies have directly compared different strategies, ranging in intensity of resources required, for improving exercise and related outcomes among patients with OA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 3-arm study was to compare the effectiveness of physical therapy (PT; with an emphasis on a home exercise program) and internet-based exercise training (IBET), both compared with a wait list (WL) control arm, among individuals with knee OA. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 350 participants with symptomatic knee OA, allocated to standard PT, IBET, and WL control group in a 2:2:1 ratio, respectively. The PT group received up to 8 individual visits within 4 months. The IBET program provided tailored exercises, video demonstrations, and guidance on exercise progression. The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC, range 0-96), assessed at baseline, 4 months (primary time point), and 12 months. General linear mixed effects modeling compared changes in WOMAC among study groups, with superiority hypotheses testing differences between intervention groups and WL and noninferiority hypotheses comparing IBET with PT (noninferiority margin = 5 points on WOMAC). Higher WOMAC scores indicate worse symptoms; therefore, negative scores for comparisons at follow-up indicate more improvement for PT and IBET at groups compared with the WL group. RESULTS: Baseline mean WOMAC scores for PT, IBET, and WL groups were 32.0, 31.3, and 33.6, respectively. At 4 months, improvements in WOMAC score did not differ significantly for either the PT group or IBET group compared with WL (PT: −3.36, 95% CI, −6.84 to 0.12, P = .06; IBET: - 2.70, 95% CI, −6.24 to 0.85, P = .14). Similarly, at 12 months, mean differences compared with WL were not statistically significant for either group (PT: −1.59, 95% CI, −5.26 to 2.08, P = .39; IBET: −2.63, 95% CI, −6.37 to 1.11, P = .17). IBET was noninferior to PT at both time points. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in WOMAC score following IBET and PT did not differ significantly or clinically from the WL group. This contrasts with prior studies showing that PT improves pain and function for people with knee OA. Additional research is needed regarding strategies to maximize the effects of exercise-based interventions for individuals with knee OA. LIMITATIONS AND SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS: This study was conducted in 1 geographic region and included only participants who had regular internet access. More than half of participants had a college education. These factors could affect generalizability to other subpopulations.  aOriginal Project Title: Physical Therapy vs. Internet-Based Exercise Training for Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis PCORI ID: CER-1306-02043 ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02312713  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Oct. 31, 2024).12aOsteoarthritis, Kneextherapy22aPhysical Therapy Modalities22aTelerehabilitation22aInternet-Based Intervention2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK606828/  pP2eEFa20241002  aIHHb20241031  aCDNb20241031  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20241002  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60682805626nam a2200493 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001500189100003500204245027700239264008500516300006400601336002600665337002600691338003600717490002600753504004100779520361900820536011304439588009204552650002804644650003404672650002904706650003104735650001304766651001804779710007204797830008004869856005004949992002104999993001805020994001805038995001905056998002105075999000905096035002705105991891689390667620241101115652.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||241002s2019    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918916893906676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWA 309 AA11 aGarcia, Francisco A.,eauthor.10aDoes an offer by phone of community health worker support increase access to primary care for women who are newly enrolled in a health plan? /cFrancisco A.

Such women may lack the necessary tools to effectively identify personal health care needs, take advantage of health services, or participate equitably in health care decision-making. Our study tests the effectiveness of a Medicaid health plan that offers new members the services of community health workers (CHWs) who use a community-developed curriculum and function as navigation aides. The CHWs assist patients to make informed decisions about the utilization of covered preventive health services and engagement with their health care providers. OBJECTIVES: The following was the overarching question addressed by this study: Does access to a trained CHW improve newly enrolled Medicaid health plan members' engagement in the health care system? METHODS: The study participants consisted of women aged 18 to 39 years who had newly enrolled in a Medicaid health plan serving southern Arizona between March 15, 2015, and March 14, 2016. All eligible health plan members were randomized 2:1 to be offered support from a CHW in addition to the standard services of the health plan or to receive only standard health plan services. We used the health plan's call center to contact those randomized to the intervention. We based the primary and secondary outcomes on analysis of 6 months' health care utilization data captured for all eligible members, and our primary outcome was a visit with a primary care provider (PCP). We also assessed patients' informed choice via a baseline survey completed by all members who worked with a CHW and a 6-month survey fielded to all members. RESULTS: The health plan enrolled 2267 eligible new members during the study; all eligible members were included in the study, and 1521 were randomized to the offer of CHW services. Of those enrolled, 78% were unreachable by the call center to complete the offer and another 5% became unreachable after expressing initial interest and before they could meet with a CHW. Of reached members, 82% said they were interested in working with a CHW and 62% worked with a CHW. Following intent to treat we found no significant difference in our primary outcome (at least 1 PCP visit) between those randomized to the offer (58.2%) and those randomized to control (57.1%). However, although not designed to directly test the effectiveness of CHW services themselves, our results suggest that support provided by the CHW might have a beneficial impact in terms of accessing primary care services. A significantly larger proportion of the group that received the CHW services had 1 or more primary care visits (71.7%) compared with those randomized to the offer who did not work with a CHW (56.6%) or the control group (57.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings do not support the effectiveness of a health plan's offer of CHW services to its members. The direct telephone-based offer of CHW services by a Medicaid health plan to new members is not effective largely due to problems with the reachability of this low-income, highly mobile Medicaid population. The lack of effect may be due not to CHW services, which may themselves have a positive impact, but instead to the way these services were offered.

While methods of engaging patients exist, variability among methods and limited understanding of how engagement impacts research may limit broader use. OBJECTIVES: The overall purpose of this Methods Award was to develop evidence on the impact of stakeholder engagement on research, which is a critical methodological gap identified by PCORI. Specifically we aimed to demonstrate whether input from patients and communities elicited using the Community Engagement Studio (CE Studio, formerly called Community Review Board)1 was more patient centered than input from a Translation Studio (T2 Studio), which is composed of researchers.2 To evaluate the input from studios, we developed a standard set of terms, Stakeholder Impacts in Research Taxonomy, to describe potential changes in research due to stakeholder input and a quantitative scale, which would be generally applicable to assessment and evaluation stakeholder engagement. METHODS: This methods study randomized 20 researchers to the CE Studio, a structured method of eliciting project-specific input from patients and community stakeholders, or a T2 Studio, which obtains expert advice from researchers. Any faculty member or research trainee at Vanderbilt University or Meharry Medical College was eligible to be randomized. Researchers who requested a CE Studio through StarBRITE, Vanderbilt's online portal for research support services, and agreed to be in the study were randomized to a CE Studio (a panel of community members or patients) or T2 Studio (a panel of researchers). Those who were randomized to the T2 Studio were also offered a CE Studio. Randomization to CE Studio or T2 Studio was done using random number generator software (www.r-project.org). Each studio panel was convened to provide project-specific input. The 153 stakeholders who participated as experts on CE Studios panels were patients, caregivers, or patient advocates identified by health status, health condition, or demographic variables based on the project-based needs of the 20 researchers randomized in this project. Stakeholders include individuals with diabetes, heart failure, Parkinson disease, sickle cell disease, and intensive care unit survivors. All stakeholder experts had experience as a partner or consultant on a research project or through serving on a research advisory board or committee. T2 Studio experts were researchers from Vanderbilt University or Meharry Medical College. All studios were recorded and transcribed, and experienced qualitative researchers analyzed the data. We compared the project-specific input elicited from CE Studios with that elicited from T2 Studios using qualitative analysis. To develop the taxonomy (the Stakeholder Impacts in Research Taxonomy) describing and characterizing wherein the research process stakeholder input has the potential for impact and the types of changes, we used a 3-step approach involving patients in each step: (1) identified stakeholder impacts from existing literature and generated standard terms; (2) evaluated the terms using cognitive interviews and a panel of researchers and stakeholders; and (3) pilot tested the terms using qualitative analysis. Because no such measure existed, we created and validated a quantitative instrument measuring patient (person) centeredness of research. We developed the Person-Centeredness of Research Scale (PCoR Scale) by (1) content and item generation, (2) item evaluation, (3) initial scale testing, (4) scale revision, and (5) revised scale testing. We tested the initial and revised scales by comparing ratings for abstracts from a PCORI conference with those for abstracts from a national translational research meeting. We determined the scale's internal consistency reliability with an exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach α computation. We also examined the interrater reliability of the final rating scale. RESULTS: The CE Studios generated input with more themes consistent with patient centeredness than the T2 Studios and also a striking number of patient experiences that were expressed in storytelling form. The Stakeholder Impacts in Research Taxonomy has 11 domains (representing categories of research activities) and 59 dimensions, flexibly framing the stakeholder engagement impact on translational research for increased understanding and more formal assessment. The domains are (1) preresearch, (2) infrastructure, (3) study design, (4) implementation, (5) analysis, (6) dissemination of research findings, (7) postresearch, (8) ethics, (9) process improvement, (10) engagement, and (11) communication. The PCoR Scale is a 7-item instrument using a 5-point Likert rating scale that successfully classified (based on expert panel assignment) as person centered 71.4% of the conference abstracts tested in discriminant analysis (mean total scores: 7.15 vs −2.08; t = 7.37; P < .001). An exploratory factor analysis showed the PCoR Scale to be unidimensional with an eigenvalue of 5.59 that explained 79.8% of the total variance, and we computed Cronbach α to be .95, showing high internal consistency reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and community members provided project-specific input across a broad range of research areas, and this input was more person centered than input from researchers. The Stakeholder Impacts in Research Taxonomy and the quantitative PCoR Scale can be used by others in the field to help standardize this work and evaluate the patient person centeredness of research products. LIMITATIONS: Although the CE Studio can be used across many studies, it is a consultative method of engagement and may not elicit feedback reflecting the full range of stakeholder engagement. Because the intent of this study was to provide evidence to support the added value of stakeholder engagement, we compared input from stakeholders with input from researchers. We did not compare CE Studios with a different method of stakeholder engagement, which might result in more or less person centeredness. DEFINITIONS: In this report, the term stakeholder includes patients, caregivers, patient advocates, and other community members, but not payers, policy makers, or health care product producers. Researchers are also stakeholders in research, by definition, but for the purposes of this report, the term stakeholder is used to distinguish someone who is a community representative stakeholder from others with interest in the research. We have used community/patient stakeholder where that clarification seemed appropriate. A community representative is a person whose primary affiliation is with a nonacademic, nonresearch community-based organization and/or who represents a defined community.3 NOTE: The term patient centered, well-defined by PCOR, is being replaced by the broader term person centered by researchers in the field.42,43 This terminology shift occurred during the course of our project, and we use both terms, reflecting the terms used during the research and moving toward the newer term during development of the quantitative scale, as noted in the relevant methods section.  aOriginal Project Title: Improving Patient Engagement and Understanding Its Impact on Research Through Community Review Boards PCORI ID: ME-1306-03342  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Oct. 31, 2024).12aPatient Participation22aCommunity Health Services22aHealth Services Research22aComparative Effectiveness Research2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK607322/  pP2eEFa20241002  aIHHb20241031  aCDNb20241031  aAUTHb20241031cREVd20241101  aBKSHLFb20241002  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60732203812nam a2200493 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001800109020001500127035002100142040002500163041000800188042000800196044001800204060001100222110014500233245026200378264005600640300007100696336002600767337002600793338003600819490002700855504004100882520131500923530002602238536067702264588009602941650001103037650002403048650001803072651001803090830002703108856005003135992002103185993001803206994001803224995001903242998002103261999000903282035002703291991891689530667620241113104200.0m     o  d        cr|bn#||||||||241002s2024    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    z9780309717854  z030971785X  99918916895306676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWW 3202 aNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (U.S.).bCommittee on Focus on Myopia: Pathogenesis and Rising Incidence,eauthor.10aMyopia :bcauses, prevention, and treatment of an increasingly common disease /cCommittee on Focus on Myopia: Pathogenesis and Rising Incidence, Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. 1aWashington, DC :bNational Academies Press,c[2024]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (xxiv, 350 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aConsensus study report  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aMyopia, commonly called nearsightedness, has been increasing globally. If current trends continue, there will be 5 billion near-sighted individuals globally by 2050. The understanding of myopia has been enhanced by advances in genetics, investigations employing animal models, understanding of physiology, ocular imaging, epidemiology, environmental research, and clinical trials of interventional strategies. To further develop the knowledge base related to myopia and to reduce the incidence and negative consequences of the disease, eye care professionals, federal agencies, and funding agencies need to make improvements to standardize care, increase funding to study treatments, encourage outdoor time, and overall facilitate the standardization of assessments and diagnostics. Progress in these areas is imperative to address the current increase in myopia across the country. Myopia: Causes, Prevention, and Treatment of an Increasingly Common Disease identifies and assesses the current mechanistic understanding of myopia pathogenesis and the causes of its increased prevalence. This report also examines knowledge gaps and barriers to progress and develops a research agenda aimed at better understanding the biological and environmental factors that could explain the increasing incidence of myopia.  aIssued also in print.  aThis activity was supported by contracts between the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Optometry; the American Optometric Association; the Health Care Alliance for Patient Safety; the Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry & Vision Science, University of California, Berkeley; Johnson & Johnson Vision; the National Eye Institute (HHSN263201800029I/75N98022F00005); Reality Labs Research; Research to Prevent Blindness; and the Warby Parker Impact Foundation.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and test PRO-PMs for use during chemotherapy. METHODS: 1. Aim 1: We interviewed 124 stakeholders to identify key symptoms to test as PRO-PMs and potential risk adjustment variables.2. Aim 2: We conducted a structured literature review to identify prevalent symptoms. We combined the results from interviews and the literature review through expert consensus into a final list of symptoms. Then, we evaluated existing PRO-PMs assessing identified symptoms.3. Aim 3: We enrolled patients actively receiving chemotherapy at 6 cancer centers (in California, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Texas). Each patient completed PRO-PM items at home between 5 and 15 days after initiation of a therapy cycle.Patients chose to complete the questionnaire online, by an automated telephone system, or on paper, and it was available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. We defined feasibility as at least 75% of patients completing the PRO questionnaire. We developed practice-level PRO-PM specifications for each symptom individually (eg, proportion of patients at a practice with well-controlled symptom [eg, pain]) and for multisymptom summary measures. To account for variation in case mixes across cancer centers, we risk-adjusted every measure using hierarchical logistic regression models predicting the odds of high symptom burden, controlling for cancer type, age, sex, and race. For the multisymptom measures, optimal cutoffs were identified as those that maximized validity (correlation with physical functioning) and reliability (ability to accurately differentiate performance across providers) while remaining clinically actionable. RESULTS: Interviews in aim 1 included patients with cancer in active treatment (n = 56); primary caregivers (n = 21); patient investigators (n = 5); clinicians without clinic administrative responsibilities (n = 11); health care administrators (n = 16, of whom 12 were also clinicians); and national experts, including clinicians (n = 15, of whom 5 were also clinicians). We recruited patients, caregivers, clinicians, and health care administrators from the 6 cancer centers and identified experts nationally. Among patients with cancer, 48% were women, 34% were aged ≥65 years, 14% were Black/African American, 8% were Asian, and 20% had a high school education or less. Common cancer types included genitourinary (32%), gastrointestinal (27%), breast (21%), and lung (20%). Caregiver relationships were typically a spouse, partner, or adult child. In aim 2, we combined a literature review with interview results from aim 1 to refine a final list of symptoms to test, as follows: gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea), sleep issues, depression, anxiety, pain, neuropathy, and shortness of breath. Although fatigue and appetite loss were acknowledged by the stakeholders as being important, we eliminated these symptoms because they are not sufficiently clinically treatable. Stakeholder recommendations for risk adjustment variables to test empirically included insurance status, cancer type, age, sex, and difficulty paying bills. In aim 3, a total of 653 patients enrolled, of whom 607 completed the questionnaire (93%). Specifically, 470 of 607 (77%) completed the PRO questionnaire without a reminder call, and another 14% completed it after a staff member called. Most (>95%) participants found the PRO questions to be easy to understand and complete. When questionnaires were aggregated to the cancer center level, 1 cancer center descriptively appeared to perform better than others across measures, and 1 appeared to perform relatively worse, with the other 4 sites grouped similarly. Adjusting for cancer type and age had a modest effect on site-level scores. Adjustment variables for insurance status, sex, and difficulty paying bills were not significant in models and were thus removed. Empirical testing showed that combining the individual PRO-PM items for pain, nausea, and diarrhea was possible, with an optimal cutoff score of 0 to 4 vs 5 to 12 and with higher scores indicating greater symptom burden. The optimal cutoff scores for the 10-item measure were 0 to 14 vs 15 to 40. Summary PRO-PMs numerically differentiated between cancer centers but did not meet the recommended reliability threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Patients, caregivers, clinicians, national experts, and other stakeholders agree that performance measures based on how patients feel and function would be an important addition for payers to use in evaluating the quality of care provided by health care systems and provider groups. PRO-PMs can be feasibly captured at home during systemic therapy and are acceptable to patients. PRO-PMs may add meaningful information to evaluate quality of care, but more data are needed to establish the reliability and validity of these PRO-PMs before adopting them into performance-based oncology payment models. LIMITATIONS: Testing occurred at 6 sites among more than 600 patients, and further testing would strengthen generalizability. Additional data are also needed to meet recommended reliability thresholds. Such testing is planned.  aInstitution Receiving Award: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Original Project Title: Development and Evaluation of a Patient-Centered Approach to Assess Quality of Care: Patient-Reported Outcomes-based Performance Measures (PRO-PMs) PCORI ID: ME-1507-32079  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 15, 2024).12aNeoplasmsxdrug therapy12aAntineoplastic Agentsxadverse effects22aPatient Reported Outcome Measures 2aStatistics2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK606827/  pP2eEFa20241002  aEJPb20241107  aCDNb20241115  aAUTHb20241118  aBKSHLFb20241002  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60682705719nam a2200457 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001100189100003300200245011500233264008500348300006400433336002600497337002600523338003600549490002600585504004100611520391500652536019004567588009104757650002404848650002804872700002604900710007204926830008004998856005005078992002105128993001805149994001805167995001905185998002105204999000905225035002705234991891689800667620241101150846.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||241002s2020    dcua    ob    000|0 eng    99918916898006676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWB 1031 aAlegria, Margarita,eauthor.10aShared decision making coaching for behavioral health providers and patients /cMargarita Alegria, Ora Nakash. 1aWashington (DC) :bPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI),c[2020]  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (95 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aFinal research report  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aBACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) in health care is a process in which both patients and providers are equal partners collaborating to make health care decisions. SDM improves outcomes and quality of care; yet, few providers actively facilitate SDM. To date, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve SDM have been conducted with ethnic/racial minorities and none have been tested in behavioral health care. OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of the DECIDE (Decide the problem; Explore the questions; Closed or open-ended questions; Identify the who, why, or how of the problem; Direct questions to your health care professional; and Enjoy a shared solution) patient and DECIDE provider coaching interventions for improving SDM and quality of care among an ethnically/racially diverse population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-level 2×2 RCT including clinicians at level 2 and patients (nested within clinicians) at level 1. We recruited participants (312 patients, 74 providers) starting in September 2013 and collected final data in September 2016 at 13 behavioral health clinics in Massachusetts. The provider intervention focused on promoting patient-centered communication as a pathway to improved SDM. It included a small group workshop and up to 6 individual coaching calls. The patient intervention sought to improve SDM and quality of care for patients in behavioral health care, independent of their clinical profile, and included 3 one-on-one sessions. Main outcome measures included blind coder-assessed SDM based on an audio-recorded clinical encounter, patient and provider SDM ratings, and patients' perception of quality of care (PoC). We conducted intent-to-treat and dosage analyses, followed by mediation and moderation analyses for patients in behavioral health care. RESULTS: The provider intervention significantly increased blind coder-assessed SDM (b = 4.52; SE, 2.17; P = .04); the clinical encounters of providers who received the SDM training intervention were rated 4.52 points higher on the OPTION ("observing patient involvement") scale of SDM, from 0 to 100 (mean, 33.0; SD, 14.43; Cohen d = 0.29). The training dosage analysis corroborated the intent-to-treat analysis, showing that greater provider training dosage significantly increased blind coder SDM (b = 12.01; SE, 3.72; P = .001; Cohen d = 0.78). We found no significant effect of the patient intervention on blind coder SDM or of the patient or provider intervention on patient- or provider-reported SDM. The patient intervention significantly increased PoC (b = 2.27; SE, 1.16; P = .049), such that intervention patients rated their care quality 2.27 points higher on a scale from 0 to 100 (mean, 89.9; SD, 12.0) as compared with the control group. Patient training dosage was significantly positively associated with PoC (b = 3.33; SE, 1.17; P = .01; Cohen d = 0.28). The interaction of patient and provider training dosage was also significantly associated with PoC (b = 7.40; SE, 3.56; P = .04; Cohen d = 0.62), indicating patients rated their quality of care 7 points higher when both obtained the recommended number of training sessions. Patient-centered communication and therapeutic alliance mediated the intervention effect on PoC. Finally, our moderation analyses suggested that the provider intervention had a stronger effect on PoC when patients and providers did not share the same primary language. CONCLUSIONS: The provider intervention improved SDM, with small to moderate effects. We observed the greatest improvement in perception of quality of care when both patients and providers obtained the recommended number of training sessions. LIMITATIONS AND SUBPOPULATION CONSIDERATIONS: We included only providers and patients who voluntarily participated in the study; thus, selection bias might have occurred. The results may not be applicable beyond behavioral health care settings.  aOriginal Project Title: Effectiveness of DECIDE in Patient-Provider Communication, Therapeutic Alliance & Care Continuation PCORI ID: CD-12-11-4187-IC ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01947283  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed Nov. 1, 2024).12aBehavioral Medicine22aDecision Making, Shared1 aNakash, Ora,eauthor.2 aPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.),eissuing body. 0aFinal research report (Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (U.S.))40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK607357/  pP2eEFa20241002  aIHHb20241101  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241101  aBKSHLFb20241002  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60735705764nam a2200589 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068020001800109020001500127035002100142040002500163041000800188042000800196044001800204060001100222100003500233245041800268264005600686300006700742336002600809337002600835338003600861504004100897520080100938530002601739536226201765588009604027650006404123650006104187650005504248650005504303650002904358650002104387655001304408700003304421700004204454700003404496700003104530710013804561710014104699711015104840856005004991992002105041993001805062994001805080995001905098998002105117999000905138035002705147991889770090667620241113085312.0m     o  d        cr|cn#||||||||240902s2024    dcua    ob    100|0 eng    z9780309719162  z030971916X  99918897700906676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWM 1691 aBabik, Kelsey R.,erapporteur.10aAdult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder :bdiagnosis, treatment, and implications for drug development : proceedings of a workshop /cKelsey R.

Evidence suggests adults with ADHD may be more likely to develop a substance use disorder, and there are concerns that nonmedical use of prescription stimulants could lead to misuse, overdose, or toxicity. In December 2023, The National Academies Forum on Drug Discovery, Development, and Translation and Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders held a public workshop to examine the diagnosis and treatment of adults with ADHD and explore the challenges and opportunities for the development of new therapeutics. The workshop was supported, in part, through a grant (PAR-23-072) from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA.  aIssued also in print.  aThis activity was supported by contracts between the National Academy of Sciences and Acadia Pharmaceuticals; Alzheimer's Association; American Brain Coalition; American Neurological Association; Amgen Inc.; Association of American Medical Colleges; AstraZeneca; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim (Contract No. 755326); BrightFocus Foundation; Burroughs Wellcome Fund (Contract No. 1023129); California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; Cerevel Therapeutics; Cohen Veterans Bioscience; Department of Veteran Affairs (Contract No. 36C24E20C009); Eisai; Eli Lilly and Company; FasterCures, Milken Institute; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health; Friends of Cancer Research; Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Harmony Biosciences; Janssen Research & Development, LLC; Johnson & Johnson; Karuna Therapeutics; Lundbeck Research USA, Inc.; Medable Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc.

They present and discuss key updates to WHO guidelines on HTS, with a focus on new evidence, new recommendations, good practices and operational considerations that respond to the changing needs of national programmes. New recommendations in this guidance highlight the expanding role of self-testing and network-based testing services, as well as integration with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the use of syphilis self-test, dual HIV/syphilis self-tests and STI partner services. This guideline seeks to provide support to Member States, programme managers, health workers and other stakeholders seeking to achieve national and international goals to end the HIV epidemic as a public health threat by 2030 and advance the importance of integrated services delivery.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 1, 2024).12aHIV Testing22aHIV Infectionsxdiagnosis 2aGuideline40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK605633/  pP2eEFa20240903  aKXPb20241101  aCDNb20241101  aAUTHb20241105  aBKSHLFb20240902  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK60563302731nam a2200469 i 4500001001700000005001700017006001900034007001500053008004100068035002100109040002500130041000800155042000800163044001800171060001300189100003100202245019200233264015800425300006900583336002600652337002600678338003600704490003100740500023500771520062901006530002601635588009501661650002901756650002101785655001101806710011801817710009701935830004602032856005002078992002102128993001802149994001802167995001902185998002102204999000902225035002702234991889770100667620241106102723.0m     o  d f      cr|cn#||||||||240902s2023    dcua    on   f000|0 eng    99918897701006676  aDNLMbengerdacDNLM0 aeng  apcc  9United States00aWL 704.61 aShekelle, Paul G.eauthor.10aEvidence map of massage therapy for painful conditions: update from 2018-2023 /cPaul Shekelle, Jennifer Allen, Selene Mak, Meron Begashaw, Isomi Miake-Lye, Jessica Severin, Emily Lawson. 1a[Washington, D.C.] :bU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Health Services Research & Development Service,cOctober 2023.  a1 online resource (1 PDF file (vii, 41 pages)) :billustrations.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aEvidence synthesis program  aUpdate of Massage for pain / investigators, principal investigator, Isomi Miake-Lye ; co-investigators, Jason Lee, Tana Lugar, Stephanie Taylor, Paul Shekelle ; research associates, Roberta Shanman, Jessica Beroes.

Civilians may experience moderate benefits at post-treatment, but these gains do not appear to be sustained. Consequently, the available evidence does not currently support these interventions as an effective treatment for Veterans with PTSD. Based on a small evidence base, internet and mobile interventions do not appear to benefit family members of adults with PTSD.  aIssued also in print.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed November 6, 2024).12aStress Disorders, Post-Traumaticxtherapy12aTelemedicine22aTreatment Outcome22aInternet-Based Intervention22aVeterans22aFamily 2aSystematic Review1 aBeech, Erin H.,eauthor.1 aAnderson, Johanna,eauthor.1 aParr, Nicholas J.,eauthor.1 aUnited States.bVeterans Health Administration.bHealth Systems Research,eissuing body. 0aEvidence-based synthesis program (Series)40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK606175/  pP2eEFa20240904  aEJPb20241106  aCDNb20241106  aAUTHb20241107  aBKSHLFb20240902  aAUTH  a(DNLM)BKSHLF:NBK606175
